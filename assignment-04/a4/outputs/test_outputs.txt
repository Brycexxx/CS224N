You know what I do is write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can stand like farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles, and <unk>
And you know that an <unk> is usually something that you fell somewhere somewhere.
You just have to turn the block to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complex circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare in class.
When I went through to bleeding every week in the bathroom bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me get into the toilet room room.
I did it in secret, it.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working on organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at night I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults we never get to know us.
You could <unk> Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to get it to you, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see us, <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman who wanted to be <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you was made up to be shown in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save out of it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about this.
It also needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my job, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around around the water -- almost 60 meters -- and I couldn't think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another <unk>
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or break the barriers of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment, and their experiences.
Some people refuse to lie, and they hold up to the end, while others can't get them more and get them into a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, by seeing a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, as much as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As an <unk> is breathing his atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg melts, a iceberg released water that feeds in many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they will not exist in the way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of his way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> which photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent going to actually see a <unk> iceberg,
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, he starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> of the water about 400 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk>
So two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much on the details of conception, because if you stop to think about it, I don't go paying attention.
Let's think about it for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm comes into the X <unk> chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome binds to the X <unk> chromosome.
They both <unk> and you start life.
We'll talk about them later.
In my activity of the ground to be <unk>
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- that we have human bodies and <unk> how have the body bodies have been <unk> the idea of <unk> what you have thought about the body.
The other role that performance is in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with <unk> twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people who are much smaller than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex individuals whose physical radiation didn't fit into male <unk> and conventional women.
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> embraces many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having an sex that doesn't fall into the common forms of male or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene from the chromosome, and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in life, the testes is producing testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the receptors of testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome <unk>
So there are high testosterone levels but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops on a dead course of <unk>
When you put the baby out of a little bit of a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes something that's going on.
After making them exams, they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called areolar glands
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I think I consider a <unk> woman, not known his <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the more exposed brain to <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way, you can be everywhere.
Another example: A few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old <unk> born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sex with her, he had a life like a kid, and I had just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had chromosomes and in the uterus -- the areolar glands were so active that essentially created a hormone hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitalia were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have failed medical problems by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> is to say, they have broken tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we were going to get to various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have an identity <unk> <unk> being black wants to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present this body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born as two people within one body.
The recent biggest case is the past year with the <unk> South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What do you test are going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't reflect a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women, we're who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more progress goes through science, we have to admit that these categories -- we were thinking of these categories -- which we thought were <unk> stable categories that are going directly into <unk> categories -- <unk> -- are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we go through science in science we get increasingly in a <unk> zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the struggles at first and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but within the <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors had never had to do with this question of whether somebody was dead.
As a lot, I put a pen in front of the nose, and if I was still <unk>
If I stopped moving it up.
But today, we can, for example, extract organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we must deal with the dilemma of really determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it gets me nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought we thought.
It would be from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so sweeping in what they did, that I find myself both watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
This is what happened in <unk> with Parents <unk>
Parents <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and tell you why.
What they <unk> was a concept of <unk> and <unk> with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember what our Taliban <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old World monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was going to be the political power of blood being passed from grandfather to father and then to son, etc.
Parents <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> <unk> That was very radical.
And part of what they were doing because it formed part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the Taliban <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed on a kind of a kind of a kind of <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about that way, but it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people who were <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people who are <unk> on the <unk> coincidence of the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish, the same rights for a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't want to say that for the age of five years they had to allow them to have sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense, and I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June June June June 1, 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, he was born at the contrary, he was born at March 1 o'clock in 1980.
And by the only fact that I was born three months before Mary had been attributed to all three months before Henry -- the right to sexual <unk> the right to vote, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for everything that doesn't have a different biological age, but because he was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered man now is <unk> <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, on its hand, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman only in some states.
So I still <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went through as much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy might be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science will become <unk>
Where are we from <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But many people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided to get married with a man doesn't have to have the chromosome and to get married with a woman you have to have a <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make test tests for people.
But this is also very strange because of the story I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to <unk>
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I "I want to <unk> it offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people who are not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I also want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> in this to <unk> rights to people, because I know I know about some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more and more intelligent and intelligent decisions about their sexual relationships that people from 40 to know.
So how do you put the subject of content on <unk>
It turns out very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
Do we really want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to lead this cultural thinking in relation to democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we will do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless it is willing to stand up to a sex change in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to tell you that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had made a couple years ago that I had made a couple years ago that he had done to give birth <unk> <unk>
But when the phone asked the operation to the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has considered political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be on your head.
Well, to end I want to say I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how it would be the democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, since I have been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in making the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to engage those who are <unk> inside the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I was <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most silly question I've heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of the stereotypes about gender, so there is nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, the more that there is something like female in <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attached to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the Taliban were very aware of finding the way to protect people in the state of state, it's possible that they have gotten more <unk> to this concept, perhaps we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So while we try to create a more perfect, think about what we do is we do what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where each family wants to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this time we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than the cost of construction.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just turned through the buildings of apartments.
Imagine half of those who wanted to live in apartments already were owners and that in the other half it will still get to do it.
They might try to increase the capacity by making <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions in the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new place, building a completely new apartment building -- always and when the standards of that place will be built the construction instead of putting it down.
So I proposed that governments will <unk> new big reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year around <unk> <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis, <unk>
In the following elections, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was setting up to give a talk for TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of testing users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of standards, like those rules that they say you can't go and write to all the current residents of apartments.
They spend a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like <unk> <unk> and they're usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link to <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> which, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was quite abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about again the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport only covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The elected leader came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed me the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a single option of a city that you could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the Carolina.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from developing countries that would help them establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they can all trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily take a thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, the vote in Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all in the society, the <unk>
<unk> in the Constitution has to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February passed the other time in another voting on a <unk>
Immediately after the voting on 21, the 21 to October 24, a delegation of 30 <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city downtown, which is building in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are setting up a legal system that would allow the administrators to allow the administrators to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allowing its Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies who want to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place on free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to live there.
The world is 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to get a job -- sometimes these are unwed mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what seems to you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or would we build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What seems to you think about how to insist for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank you read.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a confession public and that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and most recently, photograph and publish my blog and colorful and colorful and different ones for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from the second hand of <unk> markets and by hand.
Oh, thank you.
The second second stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to meet people who are general -- usually my money is going to be good <unk> My looks like <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what will I find today?
That's my size?
I love color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the point of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would think about for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring with somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I would do.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
<unk> inside exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I wanted to use after I got here to <unk>
And because you don't know me as the woman walking at TED in underwear,   that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is called a brilliant.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see it great for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> it took me to <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be a bad mood, when you're wearing a <unk> <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- you don't only get it away, they will also be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child you take inside.
Sometimes people tell me it looks like I play the <unk> or I remember his little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't see you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse no one of this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> are going with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried over and over again when people came up with this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
All of this is not going to get into my little <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, and I would give it all up.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> <unk> and <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and so on.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a depiction of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right-hand side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where are you <unk> your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extreme ones, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
Can you be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need quite logical logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really working.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see how we <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
You can have a intuition that you might have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only somewhere at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid, and I did not do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that bar in parking parking bar showed him a terrible lesson, and it's that big things don't allow them to stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have the world, except that you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with car bars with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things really weird -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all of these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point there was the physics for some years ago; you needed to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because it doesn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes playing with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit good to my logical part.
Because if everything is made of little particles, and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't go on the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why I didn't find it.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little little bit of metal, with a springboard and <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way I would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a swimming chip that is found under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up -- let those things, because I don't want to make them <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The fellow members of inanimate objects are not only people -- it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
And they would take the lights out, then you get a <unk> and we pulled all the air, and then we put it down to a temperature of less than a degree for absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free of acting as it wants.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and the way it <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when you give it a smooth drive, we could make it <unk> and that not <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of metal that make that metal piece are still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that metal was still in one piece.
And I was able to get this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are just going to take it into a small space.
You hear a lot about that the quantum mechanics is that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not really true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are. And that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss, which was here and that allowed me to get it.
It took 18 months to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, you know, with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There are a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explained in this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a big education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make really the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, <unk> we go to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the <unk> gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorite, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click, jumped inside.
They're inside, you want to go to the end of the ground.
continue to go ahead and go ahead.
<unk>
Thank you, but I've not come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you can actually get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that would happen there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems to be <unk>
And I went back and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is a game called <unk> which is to hit a Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get deeper and deeper and see that you can even get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see what there is.
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to jump again at MoMA, in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this piece of <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> I think I'd never seen it so before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things here, but I have no time of <unk>
This is really great. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all of you, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same way.
You can online create their own museum, create their own collection of all these images.
It's very simple -- we walk in, I've created this function that I call the power of <unk> -- we just ran around it.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in the National Gallery
You can write things down, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel about the contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my view, even they don't come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble humble experience.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice to its artwork and it's represented by it online.
And the great question they do today is you have this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
We call it social design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian, Italian, all of the children in Italy growing up with this picture on the wall, but the reason I'm showing you this is that has happened something very interesting in Formula careers one in the last two decades.
And sometime now, if you wanted to win a year for Formula 1, take a budget and get it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what we are, in engineering, a system of control in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing is that the systems of control in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered by networks and electronics.
They're getting computers to the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note here, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> uncle, <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
It's kind of like almost all of all the atoms will become <unk> and <unk>
And that is completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outer environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo, <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end, he took the hammer, and he threw it down to the Moses -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup, <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
By the evening early there are people here and doing <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> in France.
<unk> people make a quick call and goes to the bathroom.
Second time, End of time.
First time, <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day, everyone went into the center of the winner of the winner and the first minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just one example of how today you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do only a few years ago.
Another rapid example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume.
We know all about the origin of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a beauty, how do you get <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put them a little chip, one label on the garbage and then we started to <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's no need for need.
But the other thing we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we didn't go away, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we dropped on a day still there still there.
So if we show that to people, then we will be able to promote any change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is run over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came up and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of the water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology technology -- new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, on a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves. <unk> <unk> <unk>
It creates like a water curtain, with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels on the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to Mayor <unk>
I liked it a lot.
And we would take a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors and windows, but when you're going to come up with it opens up so that you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you lower your roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture it disappears, as in this case.
Those days always there will be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost the entire architecture of <unk>
Here it is working.
You see the people <unk> so it goes inside.
And here I am myself trying not to <unk> the test sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way they interact with had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in water and one had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as engineers, engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give our designs.
But then it's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw before, which is moving with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get anywhere near it, and you can see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each pixel with one input that comes from people, and etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of TED today, the star of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can make it all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels with the pixels with them, and the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could involve people to do something and change our environment to do something and change our <unk> environment, as the <unk> of <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make it all of us just a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing has happened in the last couple of years is that, in the last two decades, we spend the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign, we can go through the digital world of the power of the power of changing the physical world.
In our case, this may want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how will happen from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, a collective way.
The cloud is a new cloud, which is made from the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but on the pixel cover.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it will be to share the main moments of the Olympics in 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go there in there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose you tell them that, with just some changes in their genes, you could improve the <unk> by a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or you might like to be in better ways, you might be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of ourselves?
How about to live more health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What are they most excited about it.
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> from Audience: <unk> <unk>
How much people do you want creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the amount of creative people.
That's very good.
How many did memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great chemist of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that in addition to the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk> light on the <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It's about the other or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch right in an end, is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There's been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic <unk> of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And they are talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all take into the bacteria more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> asked them about the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, hearty <unk>
And we're going to provide all of the nutrients that you can want to have no effort from their part.
It's really a way that is going fast for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some hasten <unk> towards the output.
But so on, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we think about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something perhaps better <unk>
In this vast collective symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and unique human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I was born, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two stem cells.
But when the organisms show up, things start to change.
It goes on the scene sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens to the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of death in the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I was like, well, <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every year I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a gorgeous dancer <unk> clothes.
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He says, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target for the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get healthy <unk>
I wanted to reclaim health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to go through the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everyone -- the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily benefits longevity.
It doesn't necessarily apply to the bigger or the stronger or the stronger and even the smarter.
Evolution encourages creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean bacteria bacteria that can survive to the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, empty fish -- yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning underlying it would be that through medicine, in first place, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And second, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we <unk> so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation of evolution.
A second possibility is that there is an evolution of the natural kind of kind of kind of evolution of nature.
And the argument here is, the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they are <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when you were <unk> planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility -- intriguing and scary.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
First consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to the individual and family level.
Think of it also that if you could be able to choose not just the sex of your <unk> but in their own body making the genetic contributions to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year I finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome base at a cost to 20,000 and a week.
Not a lot of that you can actually make the human genome for <unk> and being increasingly close to everyone.
They get those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can do viruses that are not only going to protect us but they will induce prejudice against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against flu flu cells in a plant plant.
Can you imagine something nice about the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their kids a better chance of a healthier life to remove the diabetes, to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology that is that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases will also allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you could get it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a ticket muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that I normally could take 100,000 years and we can give it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or our grandchildren are going to have to have to them.
We're going to use these options for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to pick up selectively different attributes we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the profound thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and <unk> the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For worse, and before what you could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane filled with smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds frightening.
Well, I had a single seat that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing I could talk about to talk about flying.
So it immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
So let's get the engines.
Imagine being in an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three more <unk> words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight worker.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all of the people that I wanted to get in, and I didn't do, all the fences I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to have anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it has really changed my life.
So the second thing I learned that day -- and this is as you <unk> the George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also gave rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that it didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I'm not trying to be <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I am saying, "Please be <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to be <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in one thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade -- not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I <unk> <unk> as a tiny.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point I decided to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle of not dying that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You know, you are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please be so -- but imagine, and how do you think?
What do you say that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with lots of projects.
But the coolest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, we have a complete complete machine.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation so that obviously, graffiti is a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk about Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, I said, "A second is not that I saw Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and having a very good insurance insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody ever seen the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate with that way, and they're moving with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I introduced myself to just to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check, I didn't have the slightest idea of how I was going to <unk>
I joined up with his brother and his father there on that very moment, right now, so this is the <unk> Tony is going to speak -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it is ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside it can't <unk>
So I spoke to a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser laser, draw over that and record the negative space.
So they go through making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, and so much of the organization and a lot of <unk> we had done a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies, and we get a machine so that they could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know." This guy is great!"
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all over the world <unk> from all the corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the back garage back and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when we were born, it would have removed the frames of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we said, went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun, we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some wire wire and things from Home <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put together on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it's built -- we release the code -- we put software down into free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company that says "No."
There is no hospital I can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis has access to draw and communicating using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the other room, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a planning year, two weeks of writing intense intense weeks of all night, Tony went back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed to that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and someone finally came up to <unk> and he would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to walk with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and <unk>
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of Los Angeles in Los Angeles is going to have an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which it's pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it as possible.
None of what there was in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything from this room.
I am not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I just recognized something, and I was fascinated with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we might have to do with something that we have to do. If it's not now, you say, if I'm not me, you know?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations generally very difficult and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine in a <unk>
Design in <unk> and hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this fun of the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been looking at myself in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal to try social examine social questions in ways that we're going to make <unk> interesting ways -- and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you would see and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something slightly differently.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, volunteered to sell the rights of my <unk> <unk>
What was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you don't have any idea what it comes and according to content might be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to do.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I could not have been able to do it for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, of advertising.
And as I said before, I've got myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done -- nothing could do it for something so hard or as dangerous as you enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I try to make a film to try and product and the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film will become <unk> of product and marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that everything above the bottom, at the end of the time, has fixed pictures -- all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the brand.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people are <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea, <unk> <unk> is what? <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> It was more <unk>
He was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the mark on the brand X <unk> but we're going to make sure of all the categories that we could in the film.
You might have a shoe -- and it becomes the coolest shoe that you have to <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in "The biggest <unk> ever <unk> the best <unk> you have <unk> <unk> of "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show you the brands as part of the life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> whatever we do -- we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is transparency.
You'll see the whole process in this film.
That's the full idea, all the shot -- of beginning to end.
And I would love you to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that is the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to meet with them, but it's certainly going to be worth making a couple of big markings on it.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to see us as a whole bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be done.
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not really optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: And I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one for one, all of these companies all disappeared.
None wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present as much people as possible, so what they could do as well as they could be possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to bring the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
In reality, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were shown.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president, even the <unk> even <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it actually something changes all of it.
But why? Well, transparency gives you --  like that weird bear that still still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started to talk to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want it to be <unk> history.
We want it to give us a story, but we want to call them <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was given to me in some lie -- and there he was staring at me, as he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because he knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take out of the <unk> and go to the companies with all my team.
So what I started to see is a sudden, and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start to talk to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make a big, big, giants and others that make small films like mine.
And my friends who make some big, giant Hollywood movies, they say that the reason their movies are so successful is due to the brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to look specifically in the movie?
Every time I'm coming out, every time I open my <unk> you see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you for you.
Maybe you should put you a little bit of this before <unk>
And there it would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as for <unk> solid, <unk> to <unk>
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> into the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this is interested.
MS: What words would they use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: Okay.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you cool more time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What are you in a common guy.
I need to talk to the streets of the street, to people like me, the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do they define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, so many gray colors and things like this.
Usually I'm wearing as a sun, or I like the crystals and so forth.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of it, in part of it, partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because it <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk>
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often belong to me at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
AT: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
Let me tell me about that world.
MS: That world is, I think your world is the world that we <unk> like people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All those things come from, and they start in a place and you start in my case and start in my family, in West Virginia.
AT: What is the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's what I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
Let me tell me about the <unk> to what is that?
What's the <unk>
Why is it important, what is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You have to be afraid of what kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
AT: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Big <unk> Yeah. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yes, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but it <unk> in your <unk> brand Morgan <unk> it's a <unk> brand.
They were very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only going to be used in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements and you actually have a sense of <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are it?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and brands -- those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to give your identity your performance, your personality personality -- what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you a lot of a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like the contemporary <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical <unk>
Or are you more of the <unk> <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're a <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> you get <unk>
You are healthier, healthier, familiar, safe, safe, <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how you now use MRI to identify the <unk> centers in the brain as much commercial marketing as a film.
We went to San Paulo where they have forbidden advertising to the free air.
All over the city for the last five years, there is no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into the way in schools with money problems in the United States.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects that I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I've had more success are those in which I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> to the <unk> took their agencies, and they said perhaps these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? I would have <unk>
Well, since the film was asked in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press, TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to gain momentum.
And it's not really bad because all of the agencies we talk about it, they gave their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you get risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that's pushing it to failure.
I think when you train your employees in the averse to the risk is preparing all of their company to reward them.
I feel that what it has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to be afraid of opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Today, more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> -- has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So <unk> in behalf of transparency, who happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED company, the Foundation, Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for the next year.
The idea behind the worm computer <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds, we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software that are completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus virus into a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> enter the gray box, it hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how to discover this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these little boxes, these systems of control.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what was happening with this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab a lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for the active box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that place: is effectively working on that place: is effectively working on it.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say, for example, a power plant in the United States or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled up and <unk> the source code, and we found out that he was <unk> in two bombs and a little bit of a big one.
We also saw that they were armed armed with people who obviously had all the internal information.
They would attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 billion code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning, was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures, and we were trying to <unk> with the real world, with potential real world.
We need <unk> theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it is definitely a violent <unk> must be a <unk> white must be a <unk> white -- because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went back to a effort by <unk> his experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that cell part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to come back crazy to <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to crack the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number one is <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they are <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had between hands.
It wasn't like it wasn't like this.
The results have been from for several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to begin with.
And yet, we found that two digital <unk> pointed out to one single goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other targets to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really <unk>
There it is the gray box and you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input values from the sensors and the sensors on the pressure sensors and provide <unk> code, which still runs during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on video <unk>
It's great <unk>
And the idea here is obviously not just going to do the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine is happening, you have to open gun valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make a human operator in it.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant.
And the <unk> nor the security system will get it.
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> <unk>
It could also work too, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk> car.
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of tube <unk>
It would be possible as possible.
And if you did that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a lot of goals.
We have to face the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower,
There is one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that you can take up and have a <unk> skills or other than making wheelchair users raise and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a big strength, which also increases its speed, and they help, for example, to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on -- we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, should take on their back a 45 kilos, charge of it, and it's <unk> to take even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- injuries in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic care damage from back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can take you 90 pounds of money through variables for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this new device this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of wheelchair users on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people around the world around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people with damage in the spinal cord that when they start their life -- at 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair happens to be its only choice.
And we also talk about the population that is <unk>
His only option, a lot of times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was using Amanda <unk> who had an injury in the column that was <unk> and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It's got some sensors.
It was completely <unk> in crutches who send signals on the computer on board, here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give the motors to the <unk> and in the knees, and they make them move on this very smooth and very natural.
AB: I had 24 years at the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, skiing down the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the movement of <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So he stole up to the last bit of hope of my being.
The technology of adapting for then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs up in <unk> and rocks and even ride into the <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the chairs of wheelchair, all of the wheelchair, all of the wheelchair, to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say, hi, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, to know their cousins.
This is the world of the tropical Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor -- an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot too emphasis on what our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by big guys, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where the mortal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of big apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been approved for decades and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction will also put in danger of the <unk>
The trade meat trade, and the deforestation they make you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not quite sure.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes <unk> the love, because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish links and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots, they see the <unk> the dance and the human brand.
The game is the glue that comes us.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple unique videos of only the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> style game, and I don't speak football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what he is doing.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "You have <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common as much in Bonobos in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and promotes the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think like it, sometimes we play themselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a better and more difficult world, more difficult and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let me go through our own capacity of it.
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate play, you can be the moments where it's the most urgent thing.
So fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of the captain of a volunteer body volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers make a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a fairly high probability of it.
But there was still a race against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our homework was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night, she was standing out in the rain, she was standing out in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to go back and save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a <unk> building to save a live building, just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was expecting but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, it went to the fire firefighters who had to be able to turn off the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back by the ladder where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house, the treasures of home for the home house where, as I would expect, his trove got much more attention than my own.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house house <unk> by the brave <unk> to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at the other thing was that somebody had had a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a voluntary firefighter I witnessed generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> acts of <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made it, or they're for <unk> remarkable moments of success I'd like to remind you this.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
It was food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I am a big fan, of the concrete block there.
The first particular blocks of concrete are built in <unk> with a very simple <unk> modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges, one brick at a time.
And essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
He was called it <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to all the home.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year in the labs, Bell the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic brick to each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block of concrete, the transistor allows us to create much bigger and more complex, a brick at a time.
But there's a different difference. The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are sitting at experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics every one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about all of it is that they're linked through magnets themselves.
So you can't put it wrong.
The bricks have a code of color.
The green is <unk> the <unk> is current, the pink is the <unk> and the orange is <unk>
So you only have to assemble a blue one, and very quickly you can start to make higher circuits.
A blue one with a green is making light.
Can we put a button in the middle, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We put this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a machine machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make it faster or faster or slower it just goes on this button that makes it faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a growing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world <unk> to <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything needs to be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a flash light work, or why the door of a elevator is kept open, or how a iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics experience start playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>   A few weeks ago, we have brought the designers in the Rhode Island School of Island, who have no experience in engineering, just and wood and paper and said, "You do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> cannon on motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the reach of everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all of the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interaction world is ours.
So ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for engaging in the environment focusing on the environment.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue better and we leave the video on a side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I don't have time for time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
We took some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of getting them to the Third World we send them into the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show you the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I look at a quote, but what you really look for is that somebody else is caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for the help of this very <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- very much last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something more than citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You support <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a component ballet.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest <unk> <unk> last year.
But it does something another technology of the government <unk>
It goes viral.
A responsible reason for the city of <unk> City, looking at this app that was able to use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to have <unk>
It's very important to work on these <unk> of tsunami, but people will <unk> the batteries.
That's why he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we used to use it.
And this has spread <unk> in a organic and natural way.
If you know a bit of government technology will know that this doesn't normally happen.
The open-source acquisition acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that he had done by the normal channels it would have taken at least two and over two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the <unk> power of California that at the moment has 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there's projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that has been program in a couple of days and it spreads into viral shape is a kind of <unk> to the institution of government.
It suggests the government of the better ways to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but rather, as the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in the open way and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we can bring together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute with <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They have not given the government.
Do you feel a great frustration to that, but they don't have it <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost out of view.
And it is that if you leave aside the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that <unk> us -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> <unk> what we do together because they don't really <unk>
Now, many people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask them to do it, because things are changing.
The policy is not saying the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from -- you remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way to think about will affect the way we make change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is, especially from <unk>
This is the center of service and information center.
It's the place that calls the calls if you brand <unk>
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He entered <unk> at the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, can you open the doors of the house, put music very strong and see if you were <unk>
And it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston does not have a phone center.
It has a website and web <unk> called <unk> <unk>
We don't want that application.
It was the very clever job of the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this happened really, actually comes this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of crap. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
The <unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report was like, "I went back to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical stuff.
And it's also a great example of the income income of government <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of <unk>
I'm talking about a platform for people who are <unk> and help others.
So a citizen helped another one, but the government had a key role.
I connected to two people.
And it could have some connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper and cheaper than the government services.
When one neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
An important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but you think it's the input from the other.
That our input to the government system is vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy in order to choose a new political leader, and then we hope the government will bring our values and bring our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like a immense ocean, and the politics is the surface layer of <unk>
And underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> what it does is that we funded that that we financed as something that is operating in our against, that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy up.
Because that's where the true job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that they have written a very detailed <unk> report by 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And so for those of us who have <unk> in front of the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do with government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is to be able to rethink root the government function of government that can be expanding <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> we just have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, to <unk> I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving up that battle that we all face about who is going to talk about who is going to talk to you all going to speak.
They can express their views on any direction and they do it.
So when you face the government problem of the government not much to do their voices.
They're using your hands.
They set up the work to program apps that will work better for government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking out -- pulling out a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and so many people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, not only are the government consumers that we pay tax and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it's about the important things we have to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent the most part of the time in prisons. prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here are impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it makes sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic <unk>
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard enough, it was power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in the slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at her, and I was giving me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then I was shocked.
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> and he said, <unk> still feeling my <unk>
And if I said no, I was scared again, and if I told him I know, I left me in peace.
He had this human quality that would always want to be near it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
In occasions, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture his time and your attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room, and I looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
And so he looked at him, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up and walked around the room, and she said, "Come on, <unk> The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I said, "Now I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just want me to do three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he told me, "I second thing I want you to tell me, is you always are going to do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought I was like, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
Then, eventually he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, I have a older brother and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a six <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> took my sister and me and went to the forest.
We are just doing the <unk> of always, as well.
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same as us.
I took something, your sister also.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I had a look at the force and <unk> "Ah, not being thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying that it's a <unk> I say it for the power that has identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who actually don't see it sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe doing.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died from age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, it's so much <unk> so much despair for these facts.
One in three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, Washington, from 50 to 60 percent of all young people in color are in jail or liberty.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a criminal system that makes you much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it looks like we feel very <unk>
The policy of fear and anger make us believe that these are not ours.
We are <unk>
It looks interesting.
We're looking at our work some of us very curious <unk>
In my state in my condition, in Alabama, as in other states, you get rid of rights for always if you have a <unk> <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we compare it to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before we had the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The U.S. is the only country in the world where it has been in 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without a chance of getting out there.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people at death row people.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense of sense, you have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death is defined by mistake.
Out of nine people <unk> has identified one which is innocent that it's <unk> and released from death row.
One rate of error, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't ever be able to fly airplanes if every nine that <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> I talk about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the age that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted up to World War II.
Actually, we don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come to me, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, <unk> <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history, we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously with segregation and decades of racial development and of separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we had one another.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome <unk> <unk> without commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done that.
I was in Germany giving TED talk about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good worrying to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room was silently and a lady said, "There's no way that we have our story, we could never get into a systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> we put ourselves to the people."
So let's go on this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We could not have it?
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these things that are so difficult, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But recently, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
And in my view, you need to integrate both things together.
We've talked about the need to have more hope, greater engagement, more dedication to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
And if you think of them it is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen before.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
With innovation, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the heart of the heart.
This connection to the mind is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places and being <unk>
Well, that counseling for the spirit is almost in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allow us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to the injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the big privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, lady <unk> I called me to say, <unk> <unk> comes <unk> and we're going to bring us to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I was like, "I know I know what? I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We tried to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We tried to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and at the end of me and he looked at me, and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find ways to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk>
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lying, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't blame you is not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it is very beautiful, very beautiful, <unk> -- not judge us for our technology, for our design nor for our intellectual capacity.
By the end of the time, they will become the character of a society, not how they treat the powerful and powerful <unk> but because of how they treat poor, <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients in 13 and 14 years that have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can an judge turn someone out of what is not it?
The judge would call it as an adult, but I see a child.
I was very late at night I was awake <unk> For God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has official powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer -- a little poor, poor, white.
I started to work on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my black customer for 14 years was treated as a privileged white <unk> executive <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there have been <unk> behavior in <unk> in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical and a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only the <unk> but he had sent him to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, my God, I have to go to cut this case stupid.
I got into the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car, he walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he looked at me, he came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you?" I said yes.
And so I walked up and I was shocked.
And I was amazed at the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That was deeply linked with my interior, with my identity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we began to go.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the ones that had written those <unk>
They got the cops <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people. All right, because we talked about race, because we talk about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I got to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and let me hear all that <unk>
It was walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black <unk> with <unk> face entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> about old black people.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up, looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this young audience room to tell this young man who keeps his view in the goal of <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
We can't really be human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must lead to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who are sharing this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, from this community, to help in your <unk> to do something.
Something that's not a look, what can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to make an effort to <unk> the funds that they spend today in the effective <unk>
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases are not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't come to anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to get the law to the law of security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say that you think this is?
<unk> Actually, <unk> rate has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to supply chain for stealing a bicycle for small crimes against the property, instead of making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems like our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got excited about me here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months. <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us, the first stop of all of this data is an ancient snippet of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
That's why a <unk> of stories are looking at <unk>
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood blood, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news providing the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues -- climate change, the scarcity of the species, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average per capita income has been <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has been reduced to 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communication, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy spent 25 percent over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> in the United States, large part of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, <unk> TV, mobile mobile phones, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of this is the technology, and recently, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we <unk> on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price of price in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good time, in the war and peace in peace, in depression and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It's not stopping before any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> called infinite computing and networks, robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize personalized production all over the planet -- synthetic biology, the fuel, vaccines and food, digital medicine -- the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was spade.
I sought the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this.
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on your cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and, in particular, how can they be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have been done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each aspect of the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that to be <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that frees resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered in silver, and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason the end of the morning to Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk> metal <unk>
It's linked by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he did the aluminum something that we use it as if it was <unk>
And we would take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk>
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power was 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that the end of the decade, in the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft on the Earth, in 1990, after the country <unk>
He was a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent of ice is ice, and we struggled with the <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen, this morning, one of the innovators from <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> already <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any clean source -- saltwater, water, <unk> <unk> by less than two cents a <unk>
The president of Coke has just thought to do a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have some confidence in which this will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it to the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation that's happening today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world in the end of 2013.
I had that <unk> warrior -- has better mobile communications communications in the middle of Kenya that the Reagan President 25 years ago.
And to tell with a smart smartphone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton spends 15 years ago.
He lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So much better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> pictures, images of books and music, diagnostic technologies now <unk> and lose market value with cell phones.
Maybe the best thing to get when you give health applications up.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies into a mobile device with which you talk about, and because it has <unk> they can collect blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses that a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is from 25 percent of the health <unk>
When this device is <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that will not be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We have just passed the brand of the seven billion billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll come from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you get? What was <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billion dollars in the global economy.
And they spend more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using 3D impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion more members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
What about a voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the destruction, wherever they are, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to do for the first time?
What are these <unk>
And if they're contributions we can't <unk>
Something I learned with the X Prize is that small, guided by their passion with a goal of course, can do things -- things that were previously able to make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how the protein.
The folds determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined together and started to <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better to produce proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to get us to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a couple of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
Actually, <unk> fish.
And described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was a lot <unk> until the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross in the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, on the Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> are still saying they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 miles, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so that was made more than the average in Ghana.
when I was there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five centimeters.
So you have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty good -- he called the <unk> four.
I went out fishing in it, and we did studies in the south of the Sargasso Sea, China <unk> and, above all, in the Sargasso Sea.
What we did in there was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny spots on some <unk> remains that are fish of coral reef.
In short, the sea bottom came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
It still wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to a zone where they have never fish.
But it wasn't <unk>
We <unk> the world, but we don't remember.
I was able to start the starting point of starting a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis of the axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation would use the images to the beginning of their conscious life as normal and so well forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
They don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the <unk> of changes.
And at the end to keep some <unk> <unk>
And that, in large extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is a bit regular.
You don't lose animals.
You lose dead animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect that to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them, like I was able to be a lot of fish in this area can't be used in this area can't be used or usually not using the scientists in the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
Out of the enormous role that can make a protected protected area.
Because with marine protected areas, we really <unk> the past.
And we would have the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point has run in and extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected protected area, and they can benefit from the vision that you can do that allows you to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access -- like people in the Middle West, for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema maybe you can fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time, there was gray whales in <unk> Bay Bay -- 500 years ago.
And you have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is Cameron -- making <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are doing viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> -- when I was younger -- that seemed very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper alive in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can become famous on the Internet in a <unk>
It goes up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, only one little percentage is viral gets viral and countless views and a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this film on her home in the National National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of the summer past.
<unk> didn't tell me to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this urge to make it <unk>
The creators as Jimmy <unk> present new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider public.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants you to get the end of the week, the weekend.    KA: I won't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
Rebecca from Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators embrace a view of view and share it with a broader public, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this big internal joke then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
That's what it is.
This year they saw him about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats looking at the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up among the Internet community community.
There were <unk>
Somebody did a version of the old one.
And then international did.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> came up with a silly joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> or Rebecca or 1,200 Black or <unk> <unk>
What would script script might have been written by <unk>
In a world where two days of video are going up two days of video for minute, just that truly unique and unexpected can be able to <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't really bother me too much.
Casey <unk> I was amazed by not circular for the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you properly on the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise effect, and its humor, Casey <unk> did I have five million you saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth everything new that we make creative form.
And all this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities of participation, creative communities of participation, totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, a new culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popularity thing.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't be permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, it's just the current media characteristics -- but <unk> the average entertainment.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the job of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the unique hope of oneness and freedom of their country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been completely in vain.
The words, for both of the time, friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a little girl who was <unk> and two small girls.
For her, life had been meant to a task -- the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do this.
And then from a four years old, which challenges the fiction, a boat will slow down to the sea <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the cops and the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we got back, we take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and vacuum.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of the men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to break out for six hours.
But I can remember the lights on the oil platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, was too much for it; and the first apple I did, given by the men in the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, I was in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is composed of children.
Unlike the middle class in the middle class, whose existence I <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells of the shops were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English is <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title at IT <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and <unk> an extra mentoring in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what it should be <unk> which was usually <unk> <unk> was always <unk>
Two U.S. pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were weird <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home."
At home, where?
Something is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we moved on our day and <unk> the movement of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares started to be able to do it.
She opened a computer shop, and then studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition transition and <unk> and kids were trapped in between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
They created centers.
I lived in worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student, relentless <unk>
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, increasingly, <unk> for violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But a lot of people got aid over the years.
And by that work, when I was studying my last year, I got a young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to another, but its edges don't know.
So <unk> resident <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk to sites that I had never heard of, and in homes whose existence had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the exam and the comfort of life in a suburb -- <unk> -- one grandmother, a mother and two children ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
I reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she got on the boat.
He had never been a choice.
<unk> said to me, "and not you are not going to be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I knew about it, more was to talk about it.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what we were going to live on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, a little bit again on the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, that the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism is a mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
It was going to be a little group of people who <unk> <unk> can't <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he would make a giant bowl of soup that all <unk>
<unk> up to the evening.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the United States.
And then of one trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who was broken.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At the age of 17, he became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, had an <unk> to <unk> and to bring the cause of her, and much more <unk> caused when I won it.
He can't do it just to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in Sydney <unk> when she died at 1,000 miles, in <unk>
And I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around her <unk>
We tell stories, and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to take his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Because people who were and how life built us, we can now see that the men who would have come to our lives would have <unk>
<unk> would have <unk> easily.
I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might want to want that to know?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of easy, in the right.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, <unk> brave in every wave, the steady rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and look at it, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians want to travel <unk> a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
And so when I was <unk> the great prince Foundation of course, had <unk> <unk> a bow and a <unk> on the ground, got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very excited to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic to allow the magic to allow me.
My grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the sense that mobile phones -- the luxury <unk> and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
It was <unk> books since age 16.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device able to connect readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
He put out the text with the image, it animation, sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But why do we do that?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I got a character from the book.
And in several moments, you get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live in terms of GPS -- which is led to me.
My little girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but that magic of the childhood, those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar I was always exciting to me.
So here, we have to tilt the iPad to fireflies.
And really, you light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy was going on in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I move into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every book of fantasy there has always been maps but been static.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it's also <unk>
I'm going to come in.
Another important aspect of me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that tries current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not gone out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go out abroad, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the children are no longer doing it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual you have to go out and, in a chapter, we would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
On another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction in which you come out with the iPad and the video on and it actually goes on and by augmented reality -- you see a group of encouraged that appear on the tumor plants.
And at a moment the screen is full of leaves on a moment.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you have to be able to read the rest of the book.
We are going to a world where the forces of nature will relate to technology and magic and technology will come up with another one.
We would call the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that I sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of <unk> projects.
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that everyone -- or maybe not everyone, but most of the projects of <unk> fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale? It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning, I was shocked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge of getting to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem of weight, is not at the same time in which I need <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than four Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I got up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also so that patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the week it is going to be available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would go from their homes, from their homes, and take their blood pressure, <unk> them to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, they become <unk> and being captains of its own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges we face, like the firing of attention from attention to the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to involve patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share it with you with a video.
We all have a security controls in the <unk>
Maybe we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are in <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please look at it, and when it's open open, because sometimes it opens up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> are already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app to <unk> <unk> to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cellphone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to make it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that they will help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They might be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in its place.
Please <unk> this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, it's photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke with my first digital camera for 15 years.
I mixed up with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera that process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by <unk> the <unk>
You know, like this, a building in a very crowded road ...
But it has a unexpected.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to look like it seems to be captured in some way as photography.
I think you're going to have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look true.
They're the details or the <unk>
You want the light?
What is the thing that creates the <unk>
Sometimes illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's about our way to interpret the world, and how you can perceive in a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we took different pieces of reality and together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, they can create something that still seems <unk> as if it was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's get it to the brain because the brain doesn't support the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really going to combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture seem realistic I think they're those in which we don't even <unk> the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important, because otherwise something looks wrong.
So I would like to say there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are infected with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make us impossible to distinguish the beginning, and the end of different images with perfect connection.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And I think it's easier to create a place that is going to find out because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to find them to find the different locations for the puzzle parts.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a stone pit of stone.
And yes, I even did a red house at the top of the island to make it look more <unk>
So to achieve an realistic outcome I think it takes planning.
It always starts with an idea.
Then you have to combine all the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful, and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general way.
It's about an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
You get more intensity, because writing about paper.
Why would we <unk> technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve that, say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any measure of technology that I want to look at the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
He doesn't say a lot.
But if you look at it, for example, another technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If today's transportation technology will be as fast as the past <unk> we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it's not going to go through that pace.
There's no precedent in the history of the technological development story that every few years orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these <unk> curves we see that they don't continue forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
And I have one of two things.
Or well it's going to become a typical curve, I know how it comes up to something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is: What is that new way <unk>
Why is new state in the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're immersed in it.
I remember the future was happening in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because something is going on.
There is a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things along the long term.
The time scale I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with many chemicals that are going around around it.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, there was a simple version of the oil with all sorts of chemicals on their inside.
Some of those drops of oil held a particular combination of chemicals that made them separate materials from the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> mobile forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them had a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, drops that in some way will be better at being better at the time of bringing the chemicals together, <unk> more, <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
And usually they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, very simple chemistry, but things are interesting to be interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way we don't understand very well these <unk> learned to store information.
They learned to get information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, they would go into this safe evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The incredible thing is that that system of writing seems to have remained stable since that evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living thing is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white powder that I'm trying to hide the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of them for every single person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it into a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
And the DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells very happy about another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things are very different in which things were very different and was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information by forming cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now have many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to place that communities would make communities that, in a way, they were together on it, and a <unk>
That <unk> or <unk> way, or whether a community was very successful -- all of the individuals in that community will become more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities went close so that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board on a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities and communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't run their own.
The skin cell doesn't serve the heart, or the <unk> or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened inside these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they weren't doing more than processing information in community.
These are the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that <unk> the information that those mobile cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of the evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, will learn to not eat some fruit because he knew bad and got sick at the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these data processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit on the other.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here emitting some <unk> and, hopefully, building a similar idea: <unk> and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated -- we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
Now we spend similar to periods of periods of <unk> organisms -- our online methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than what we did before.
Now evolution can happen in time.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> evolutionary <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history that told you took billion years ago each one.
The next stages of the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following, the language etc., took less than a million years.
And beyond, as the electronics, looks like a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the recent evolution.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to make it <unk>
I don't know that each transistor on that machine machine.
There are billions of millions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that it does something that you could not use it, it goes much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using -- is the evolution itself.
So we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of time.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please have a computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these random instructions to run all of those programs, and take those things that are more likely to do what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to give you a simple example to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more close to <unk> numbers.
Of course, you are unlikely to have some random sequences.
But one, luckily, could you find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that they did the <unk>
They were going to get those and bring them to the rest.
And now <unk> the <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children would make the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Listen to it again.
We would have some mutations in it.
And it tries new and tries again with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in particular cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to take them to see how they work.
These are strange programs, strangers.
But they hit the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of getting the goal because they come from a hundreds of thousands of programs that they did.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
Once I was on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he grabs a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer an <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the human engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there is.
In that sense, it's going in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what is coming here.
But now comes the lunch, and I think I'll stop here before I was shocked.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to allow me to give up some of my fake <unk> in that.
Before we treat my talk, we talk about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the end, the World <unk> is coming.
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of getting <unk> <unk> talk about the statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talk about 300, of a <unk> which <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing ball into the field field without being <unk> and that anybody who tried to be <unk> to the first base, not coming to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three attempts to 10.
You know what they call a 300 <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who from 10 strokes, hit you.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of the League of <unk> in making more 400 strokes on a regular season.
Now I would take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has a number of 400 in <unk>
This doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place, and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family physician comes back to a cardiologist whose record in <unk>
But you know what?
She's improving this year better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask:
What do you think should be the average of hits from a heart surgeon or <unk> of a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, for a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending me to the world, and I would include the <unk> of being perfect.
I would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once a fellow in high school, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood <unk>
So you know?
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nursing residence of General in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> quantum diagnosis and not standard.
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis of how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much as they <unk> more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were going to do everything, then you would know everything, or as possible as possible, close to everything -- because this is going to make me <unk>
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency school service, where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room requested to a cardiologist I got to go to that patient.
And to report to the <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which <unk> a <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's a difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did this and I went to work on the treatment that I would give him out.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him <unk> of water, so that it could be <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started to feel better.
And I was very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent him to his house.
I actually made two more errors in fact.
I sent it to his house without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have in fact, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring it out of <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that <unk> constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
He sent her home to his house, no attention to a voice in my inner which was like, <unk> not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so certain that until I asked the nurse to <unk> <unk> "Do you believe it is okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought about, and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high, and the ambulance next to the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in our stomach.
But I went with my work.
At the end of the day, I went back to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that moment I did something I don't normally do normally, I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I do not do normally, I do not do normally, at that time.
I went home.
And there was another nurse, not the <unk> of <unk> lady before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most emergency medical doctors.
Other specialists fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: right?
The patient remembers the patient sent to his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with the other nurse <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and at the edge of death.
At an hour of an hour she reached his house, after I read the high school, suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance brought to the emergency room with a blood pressure pressure -- which means a shock of severe.
I just barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave them medication to raise blood pressure.
They put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and expected all of the hope that they would be.
And in the two or three days it was clear that he never <unk>
He had permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be happening to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they left his lady -- <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The few weeks later, I was reminded of it and experienced it for the first time -- shame that there is in our medical culture, and I felt only, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford it with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame is <unk> which I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was that what we did was that we were bad.
And that felt felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take the things out and made sure that I didn't get stuck.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I say to my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little on that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day, he was opened the sky and finally came out the sun and asked me if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I was able to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not making more errors, I would offer those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back again.
Two years later, I was an interview in the emergency department in northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He took him penicillin and sent him to his house.
But while he ran the door to the door followed his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he gave the three words: Does you remember you?
Remember the patient to see by a pain in <unk>
He went back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but it's going to be on the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
him, fortunately, it didn't die.
They have failed antibiotics to go <unk> and put it down.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the emergency turn, not <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send it home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
It was an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out normal. A colleague who was checking the patient to <unk> some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, and called the surgeon to the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I had a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it, and when you see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, I call the surgeon a surgeon.
Both of them were operated on and recovered as well.
But each of the case is <unk> me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and support.
And here's the problem: If I can't come up and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what it really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I could go back to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When did the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party I'm going to hear about other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- you think I'd have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> which they make mistakes and the ones that do not sleep and the ones that I know they can't sleep and the ones that I know have <unk> results that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get rid of medicine to people who make mistakes, will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism -- I've done a personal TED study and errors to learn how possible, since the first article I wrote for the Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, white, white, art.
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We worked in a system where the errors are happening every day in which one in 10 drugs are wrong, or <unk> is not right in a system where neural infections are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 40,000 Canadian by mistakes medical errors are dying in this.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we didn't get stuck.
<unk> sleep is <unk>
We can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with pain pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in his chest, comes up with <unk> eyes, and I get to <unk> and all of a sudden, my story was <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't heal their symptoms as well.
All of this, errors are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we remove every professional professionals to error, well, I don't get any one.
And with respect to people who don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art -- it's a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, blah blah -- "What are you your <unk> and <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> to slow down, and <unk> saliva and starting to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where you can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The twin doctor is human, you know human, accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They would have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intent in <unk> but in a loving way, and of support for everyone to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make errors in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human being, <unk> errors do.
And I feel a lot but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me just conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day off.
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of elections that he says to pick a half American American, they're about 70 to a day.
It doesn't do a lot, on a research followed for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks by these executives and the time that <unk> in making decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of their choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category nine minutes and how many of an hour?
How do you think of the way that these decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choice to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
And then when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for giving you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student, at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> level at least at that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 percent <unk> and this was when we made water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asking myself, why don't I buy nothing?
This is the shelf oil <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I said, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses filled with tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment. This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
<unk> a post for <unk> right at the entrance to the store.
We put out there <unk> from six <unk> or 24 flavors and looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a quarter that when there was only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there was only three three percent got to buy <unk>
If there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were found six.
Well, you decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have an less good thing to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the <unk> problem of options is affecting us in <unk> decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this doesn't get us.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at the decision about savings for retirement of about a million Americans, from a few hundred plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money available for savings for savings for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people to save for the future.
And we discovered that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different choices.
We found that the bigger it was the number of money <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the death rate was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funds, the death rate went into the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choice, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater it was the number of options, more people are going to help and avoid the actions of investment.
As much more choice, they were more willing to invest in market financial standards.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that are <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative implications to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is to make the decision, the <unk> even when this is going on against self-interest.
They're more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less likely to pick up, even though objectively you want to go better.
The main reason is that we were going to look at that massive variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do calculations for we can contrast and pick out that amazing <unk>
Today I want to talk to you about four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test their businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But what we're seeing is what we're looking at is that if you decide to cut, get rid of bizarre options -- there will be an increase in sales, we'll have the costs -- there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> increased the <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and under costs.
You know that on average, in average, they deliver 45,000 products.
In a <unk> store you have a hundred products.
But the largest store in the world now is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the best options is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard.
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a security fund.
People who really want to choose, you give them 20 dollars, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all kinds of choices.
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those choices.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience on a holiday with all the best road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give them an applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> <unk> All right, whatever is ready to accept supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first turn, which in the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> of choice that is <unk>
So people understand differences among choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must feel very much <unk> very concrete <unk>
Why is people spend 15 percent more on average when they use debit cards or debit that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make them more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting, you know, exactly how do we <unk> we did a little <unk>
And what we added was that we would bring the staff to the staff that you would think about the positive things that they would find in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that in the grocery supermarket <unk> the computer display can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think that on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> giving a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think that on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> giving a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This <unk> framework is totally useless.
The categories must tell you something that we <unk> not to the <unk>
And you often see this problem with those huge datasets here.
I mean who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than what we think, if you just get a little bit.
We have to increase the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision, <unk> buy a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows for <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offer each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
So you have four choices.
What I'm going to do is vary the order that decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go in a few choices, four <unk> at 56 colors, many choices.
And what am I going to <unk>
What are you involved in.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> the <unk> button and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was alter the order of order that information happens.
If we started with it, you learn to <unk>
Even though you pick up the changes of change, it doesn't say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can make it <unk> we can handle more categories of less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques I've told you were designed to help handle the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful for <unk>
And the more you are going to be in our own choices, we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> East Germany, <unk> if you had a type of writing should be <unk> in front of the government.
There was to register a sheet of text text with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
We don't think in the West we don't think somebody could do this, how much that this is <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any laser manufacturer and it prints one page, and that page will end up having a little yellow dots on each page that they follow a pattern for one and a printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the world online, we can put up the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The mobile phone <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are actually a lot of online <unk> online, <unk> <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it for illegal media by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> He's <unk> your <unk>
And I say that today it's more likely to be any victim of a <unk> that of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most of the crime crimes are online.
The second group of investing in importance is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate them the opinions, they ensure laughs at them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or actually it was.
<unk> the ground last fall because of a <unk>
We would give the safety of the site and took a <unk>
Last week, I asked, at a meeting with the Dutch government <unk> I asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> death of people who are causing the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how did people cause a attack from these?
<unk> is an automated authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you get the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except that we would bring a foreign foreign authority.
And they were going to be <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> <unk> headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a company based in Germany in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros by 280 government.
The headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools for <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are suspected in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going to be there.
They <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen online, to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks something bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could be able to trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we would spend today, will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, I live in Kenya, in the South National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, National Park.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences at most of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed by the night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found it very bad -- because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
The dying are warriors who protect our community and livestock and they are also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is just so few in the National Park.
A child in my community, from six to nine years, is responsible for livestock and his father was responsible for me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scary.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because even helping lions see the pen away.
I didn't give me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to trick lions to believe that they was near the <unk>
But the lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they looked at it, but the second day, they went back and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he went out and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions came out.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch switch that starts and turned out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> electricity to the small box. I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And that's what lions see when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never came back to have trouble with lions.
And houses of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed her many animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it at seven homes in my community and they're serving very much.
And my idea is also used now for all of Kenya, to frightening other predators as <unk> <unk> and it's also using to separate elephants from farms.
Thanks to this invention, I had the fortune to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and installed lights on the houses that they don't have, and teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a child in the meadows in the savanna and the cows of my father, and I used to see flying planes, and he said it would have a day in one day.
And here I am.
I got a chance to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate to <unk> but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to hear a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working in other electric inventions in the other equation.
What is the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence near a CA: CA: A fence <unk>
<unk> I know they were invented <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would take you one time, right now, right? I've tried it before, but I just couple because I got a <unk>  CA: On the foot of <unk> Richard <unk> you're something big.
We're going to take it in every single step that you would take my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Don't <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed in <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never starving.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That he said, "When I did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the past two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very shocked.
It was the first time I heard the people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking across the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in her arms looking at his face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine <unk> North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more frequently -- the energy <unk> everything around it was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, just crossing the river since my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, enabling North <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North refugees in China were considered illegal migrants to illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny of back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I was terrified at the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then I had my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode it.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to go.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a official told the other, "This was a fake. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of you can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there were <unk> were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to reach out, many other North Koreans haven't had so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all their world can be <unk> in a moment.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to go back to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
It was a much greater challenge of what was expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I realized that there was a big gap between North and south.
We are all <unk> but inside, we have become very different because of <unk> <unk>
I even went through a identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call my pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea, it was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the <unk> <unk>
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as my sister was going to be shifted to the force to be shifted to the force in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took one flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to <unk> in some ways, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took one week, and we almost went caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and approached by a Chinese officer.
He asked all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in a short distance from the embassy from South Korea.
I was going to come in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would want to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary -- I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two Koreans and take them out of prison.
And I went through with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told you.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unfamiliar is a new hope for me and for the village <unk> when they were more <unk>
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the international community support are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea, and I came up in South Korea, and I came across South Korea.
But to achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or any money.
So we can benefit from the international community to education, practical practices to work and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with relatives still and we sent information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've been a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Africa an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Korea around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern Center.
This is Center for <unk> stores and fast food <unk>
So the city planners came together and thought, we're going to change the name of South <unk> so that it represents something else, so it represents something else, so they changed the United States, South America, as if this is actually wrong in the city.
This is the North L.A.,  <unk> of <unk> fast food <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles South, home from food places to bring and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that places of food to bring people to get more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles South.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
So I was going to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come from home you see the effects of food that the food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> wheelchair and sold as cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also have tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that has no pesticide has pesticide anymore.
What I did, was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a land strip we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x three me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to do it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So it was how I decided to do it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we get together and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are kind of a group of <unk> paid by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then somebody gets <unk>
The city gets to me on top and summary gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made a <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court rate for plant food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's go."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I spoke to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called it to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America.
It has 68 miles of terrain.
That's about 20 <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why on earth does it not look like this?
A plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy to South Pole.
I grew up there. Tell my children there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardening is my <unk> I cultivate my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It was <unk> to see what the Earth can do.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the earth.
We are the land.
It's <unk> to see how they affect children.
<unk> is the more <unk> act and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one time, who came a mother and her daughter was like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden, I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, man, I was there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't believe people go to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I don't fear that you're going to be <unk>
This is in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to make it <unk>
There was another occasion when I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant their mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, and they work on a volunteer plan.
If kids are growing up, kids will eat <unk>
If you cultivate <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if nothing of this is going to tell you how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're worried, I see guys who are on this path designed for them, which leads them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity that we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy.
I didn't get stuck.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free, it's not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to put people out of the street, to get the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening out of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take their <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to kindergarten.
Woman: Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  So you probably all agree with me where this is a very precious road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, which it rains, very much.
You can have a lot of water in asphalt in asphalt than <unk>
And especially if you go on on their bike and these cars are going to go through that is not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, it's very close to the cities, we would want a quiet road quiet there.
The solution for that is to do asphalt roads of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most roads in the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can happen through it, so all the water water flows into the sides and you have a road because it's easy to drive, and we don't have water anymore.
Noise will also disappear.
Because it's very open, all of the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road on it.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> you see that on this road the stones on the surface of the surface of the surface.
First one stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and so on, well, I'm not going to do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and they won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk>
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so there's only a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you <unk> they will be <unk> and will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel and that to clean <unk> and we can cut the iron knitting in very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel and steel <unk>
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel -- melt the <unk> the <unk> flowing through these <unk> and stones would move back to the surface.
I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big machine machine here on the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to get to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So donated a piece of road, 400 feet on the highway <unk> where we had to make a lane lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test test on road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of payload into them, and we had a lot of burden in them, and then we had our <unk> machine and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel fibers incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even to increase the life of the surface. They actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether it also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool first before I can show you how the play acts of it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC BBC in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those days, because the news usually has been <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> "I screamed my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban came out of Afghanistan and did illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was amazed as a child to <unk> my older sister that I couldn't be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could do it <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one could suspect where do we <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market bags for it seem to be shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us had a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we had our own life, the teacher, students and our parents.
Once in a while, school was suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where they <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was <unk> and daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote <unk> remote Afghanistan, in which her daughter, my mother, out to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my educated mother became master's again.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to turn our house into school and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate their children.
Over the years of the <unk> I remember that there was moments when I was very frustrated by our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said, <unk> daughter of mine, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can <unk> your house for a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So, you even want to don't <unk>
I am 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than high school, and if my family would have been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate my career.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> her home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't only about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the hard desire to take advantage of opportunity.
And I see his parents and his families who, like the friend, <unk> for them, despite the time, despite the time in front of a controversial opposition in it.
As <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went from the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to his house, they are the phone, a voice told him that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and this is something that is very often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been a key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of your daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school they count in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And so we found that these changes didn't last last lot, after the retirement of the U.S. soldiers.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and his parents who would <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a <unk> future and a <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> will be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forget the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get back a revolutionary <unk>
They have spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution just inspired by the surge of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of rage and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was <unk> it was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were at the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, are carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the East <unk> to the West, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some losses from about 50,000 dead <unk> we could release our country and remove our country to <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the regime <unk> regime destroyed the infrastructure, culture and moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have loved alongside many other women, rebuild civil civil society -- <unk> an inclusive transition and right towards democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation ...
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about the development of capabilities and engineering skills.
With an incredible group of women, we started the <unk> of Women <unk> for the <unk> a movement of women, leaders of <unk> leaders to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of women and for our right to participation <unk> in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> of the liberal politics of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was FDA and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little bit, the elation of elections and the revolution as a whole, was <unk> every day in the history of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of murder of the American ambassador and the attack in <unk>
Another day we woke up with the murder of murder officers from the military.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> abuse of human rights and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up a revolutionary mindset, and more and more of the ideals of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all today with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to tell us that we, as nation, we choose badly, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't brought peace, stability and safety to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with color policies of domination and <unk> both by men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the election -- that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of women's more than to need the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents agents and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, that not only <unk> but it also puts the mercy instead of <unk> and collaboration instead of competence, inclusion rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, needs desperately to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about interrelationship and <unk> between women's <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in a existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known for all of the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that fits all of the humanity that men and women, that all the tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, as the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion would spread all of existence.
So this is what it looks like to us, "My mercy does all the stuff."
This is what it is like, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
They are going to have the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a funny question that has an equally important answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody gets <unk> Why is she left?
Why was anyone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not psychiatrist, no social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had just been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> green <unk> and had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times -- the man, that I believed my soul <unk> <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone else in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times what I can remember.
I am here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the <unk> list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson and Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married my second husband and have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone -- all race, all race, all religions, all the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse are all happening in <unk> <unk> and long duration of the other way, in families -- the last place where we would want to or we would expect to find <unk> why, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to stay with a man who went through him, and I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and more than 500 women and older girls at that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went into a typical victim, because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their patterns or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was sitting next to my side in the subway in New York and he started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field guy.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and <unk> <unk> and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that he did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partners.
He did it all over the beginning of the beginning, in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- which was ready -- that I had gone to Harvard, that he would put passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why I was in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I wanted to quit my work and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a <unk> <unk> that was entering head in a physical, financial trap and carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here's where they come in the scene those <unk>
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site is supposed to be so safe to get bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in their pocket.
And he said I needed those guns to cause the trauma they lived with.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and, although I never had lifted me up my hand, my life was serious for me, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack in <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven o'clock in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit from my mother and married him.
Despite what had occurred, I was sure that we were living happy for always, because I loved him, and he wanted me to have a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just a lot of <unk> for the wedding and the fact that I could form a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I would never have any harm.
I spent two times more in our moon.
The first time I was driving towards a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple days later, driving back on our moon of honey, he was going back through the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three women is a victim of domestic and domestic violence at some time in their life, and the Disease Disease Center, reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man and was the only person in the world who could help us tackle their <unk>
The other question everybody does is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why did I not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me this is the most sad and painful question that people do, because us, the victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence happen after the victim has put the relationship, after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include Alzheimer's, even after the <unk> has returned to the permanent resources of financial resources, and the family court system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who claimed their mother.
And yet we continue to ask why they're simply going to go?
I was able to go through it because of one last <unk> he goes up to beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, if it would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told all of the world to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like headlines -- women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
And for some people is a way to say "The fault is yours by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> from men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were able to <unk> who learned a lesson from what happened to them and they would bring their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, fully free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence, very typical violence.
I went back to marry a man cute and kind of nice man and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to have ever before, would never, ever have been a charged gun to my hands on someone who says that she will.
Right now, it's just thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what silly <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my mad love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I continue to do it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse alone in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence, simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need everybody.
We need each of you understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues and family.
They would take their vision of survivors as fantastic and <unk> people who have a <unk> future.
You know, the early signs of violence to intervene at <unk> to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe output
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the face of safe and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call this Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress that way.  Luckily, I brought clothes out of <unk>
This is the first place of clothes on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to <unk> now, but we'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These 1986, are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to spend this sweater, by the head, because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so you don't do anything as I covers my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed fully what they thought about in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer, I was telling me that he would go back and get her back to the child's hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan that I did two days ago for work, there are very little enough that we could do to transform our looks, which, while shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but it <unk>
The first question is, how does it get to be model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetics, and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed for <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to use to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now show up, and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> Hold out there -- <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> because we learn so much of models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> is to say, less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always do is, "Can I be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what I really would tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first one.
If you got this spectacular list, it's still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of <unk> of American magazine or the <unk> executive director or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you be larger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike surgery, <unk> can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you take your studies, and you have a wave and a few jobs on your backs, no longer matter what I mean, if you want to be president of the United States, but your wave <unk> Model <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would look like you weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, you know, all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was passionate about, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know that we're entering your personal terrain, but it was a little girl.
I was looking at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team in <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of <unk> <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is, do things for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the dress of free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> is sorry, agent to be able to continue <unk>
I'm going to make sure of these privileges for me, not because I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of what they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and Latino kids, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino people in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's how many times <unk> me and <unk>
When I first investigate this talk, I found out that for 53 percent of the <unk> in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people do is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair -- you feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing power to work with creative people.
And that's all true, but it's only one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, with a little smaller legs and the brighter hair will be happier.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most brilliant legs -- the brighter hair and the <unk> and the <unk> but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of race and race and gender and <unk> when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that I kept from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you with my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to whom the <unk>
There was no <unk> and no chance to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum amount of care in light.
In fact, most of them just took them into random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me up this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday -- that's the <unk> corner and the 5.
He gave the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday birthday came to me, my wife told me, why don't you take me back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we start to ask to ask the tourists that they were going to come up with us.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a whole whole thing is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old could be able to understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interacting with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, on one of travel, we were walking walking, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the dolls that <unk> <unk> on previous <unk>
And described to me what I had felt about five years in that same place.
So I remember his heart <unk> with strength by seeing that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks in New York is universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I realized that one of the most important things we created are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that comes up the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and he didn't go to get someone and asked, take a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group of aquatic birds.
First of all, why are they so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughter. <unk> like <unk> <unk> characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press -- laughter, laughter, and <unk> -- these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept.
I don't accept. Do you know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  <unk> they don't help prevent disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And they're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There is the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the World Bank -- and the World Bank -- where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 people who are <unk>
So why are you <unk> they're important? First, they provide vital ecological services <unk>
They're our natural garbage <unk>
It <unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill killing all of the bacteria they help absorb the anthrax that will not be because they would stretch out and cause big loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers are taking three to four times longer in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous important importance.
They've been associated with the ancient culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the United States and below Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> Tasmanian devil <unk>
In the <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> <unk> in places like Tibet, -- there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, what it means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey from the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a stance.
Because there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge period of time to <unk> the number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up of the lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and to the <unk> market.
So what is you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so I will focus on a virtual problem is not going to serve it from nothing.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these marvelous creatures and services that we <unk>
How can they help do; it can become assets, making noise. You can write a letter to their government and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures. <unk> their time to spread the word, <unk> the word.
When you leave this room, I will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed because he saw them fly without effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, being much more poor without these marvelous species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> young, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> East <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the exception that Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you would do, you know?
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we came in with <unk> seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent Valley of Zambia to the river <unk> and we teach the local ability, Italians and <unk> and so ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would give them to come to work, and sometimes they were not going to come to work, and sometimes they were who, in so <unk> valley, they had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible to do nothing, we simply said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> to save people from Zambia in the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> Look how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were cute <unk> and the red night in the morning, 200 <unk> appeared from the river and they ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't we? You never have <unk>
I thought we only want to think that only we were doing mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, what they were doing, what they were doing, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>   <unk> to see the waste that we gave people from Africa.
He wants to read a book, I read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries, Western donors, we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
It's part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any different culture as if they were going to be my children, I want you a long way.
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face "I'm small is <unk> written by <unk> who said about everything economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years just answering the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never hit anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? It <unk>
It would never get a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We get together in a coffee bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, they would tell them, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they <unk>
So planning has this point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't go on to their public meetings.
What do we do? We do one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family physician in the table of your kitchen, in the coffee table, and that helps you find the resources to transform his passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this bow that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on, and the government came to me to see what you can do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And I was <unk>   So the government says, <unk> again."  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of isolation.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business policies of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of a company company.
The planning is the kiss of death of the <unk>
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to talk to you.
You have to offer them to hear it, privacy, it has to be great at <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 <unk>
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you talking about this tomorrow?
<unk> local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossil fossils and a moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable form.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There's an extraordinary story that I read in a research magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year we got together with this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wasn't there in 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life from New York.
So what does it do for the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States -- <unk> generic companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer them <unk>
Otherwise they will not come to talk to you.
Then you have to offer you an absolute dedicated <unk>
And then later you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, the bigger company, has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to be fantastic, and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, selling and looking for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the 100 <unk> of the <unk> world, <unk> Edison Ford, all new companies, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
I don't have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't only when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in bars in bars in bars in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who will ask you, what will you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." You want you to <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all of the neighbors, so we don't take much knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad time?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giants that give <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always fits the music.  There is a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful relationship in the world, but also one with the largest amount of abandoned properties.
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
Her death was sudden and he was shocked.
I thought a lot about death.
And this gave me a profound gratitude for the time living and the time.
He gave the significant things of my life today.
But I want to keep this look in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch on the day and to forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I die -- I want to be <unk>  "Before I die -- I want to sit on <unk> on the assembly line.
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
"Before I die I want to give you a more."
"Before I die I want to go to the rescue <unk>
"Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laughing at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving up the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we are growing and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to do a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues at the civic center we did a kit and now has been walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very short and <unk>
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we would prepare for death is one of those things that we get more power.
Think of the death of the death, our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media for sharing hope, the people that surrounds us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, and it's very <unk>
Don't speak, but it's 15,000 better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
This is shared. <unk> will happen what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice in this: has never been <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to tell you it reminds me of one thing: the little thing that we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that he came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we maintained when I was four years old, I would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and Mr. Lady birthday birthday.
It doesn't look like that."
But most people don't.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of normal, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you wouldn't consider it inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term -- it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different than Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster increases in the world, there is no cause or no cure for them.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new thing to be in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
It was a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
They lived alive and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eating anything that would have <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were getting more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments in which I would have thought they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change by normal.
<unk> is going on the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> These are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their inner and, honestly, the pursuit of blood is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and the change dies at the time that we try to be like others.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher, who would give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> of these students with their big minds, their big books and their great words and their great words.
But when those conversations, I felt the thing that <unk> must have felt when he fell through the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students. I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We need desperately a major communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our greatest challenges from energy to the environment and health care of health, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure you can see that their science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us just to study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when they're describing their science, care about <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing as making them dumb <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can be clearly communicating with their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies. They're ways of moving and <unk> with their content.
And when I present their job, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do you do the <unk> the bullets are killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's moving too much in the language of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you provide graphs that will bring our other senses, and believe a deeper sense of understanding of what they would be.
I think these are just some key things that can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they have fixed this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford Oxford Oxford <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century who defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who looks for a public charge without whatever party platform, or a very beginning, and that, when he won, you get it by the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that Parliament finally allowed newspapers to look at the newspapers to quote the exact words they were said in the <unk> camera.
And all this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had the sufficient courage to deal with them, and at the end had such a popular support in London than I won it.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's literal question.
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They introduced all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it the state of State, <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given run.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be able to make it <unk>
They didn't want to call him the King of whether he was giving him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more and more <unk> and more unfortunate <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was no idea before, but it was only meant to make a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a trivial title of <unk>
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious title with a title as ridiculous and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate was not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I have been able to figure out the Senate has never been used for the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this is the most important, and with this -- I want to tell you -- is that the President of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy in the world and a fleet of flying air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has fueled the title of <unk>
So at the end, he won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So at the end of the Senate won and the House <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to give you to you.
Political people try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually change the most words that what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at <unk> in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but all of this cacophony of male <unk> and stones and stones with young tools.
Like each other, I carry a cheap flashlight of light <unk> they would lie to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole from a meter on the ground.
I got my hand away, and I suddenly remember a mining that I met when he lost control and dropped countless feet on that hole.
As I talk to you today, these guys are at the deep part of that hole at risk of their lives without paying reward and, often, dying.
I went home from that hole, and I went home but they might never do it, because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the West of Peace <unk>
Among all of the incredible people I met there was a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO which is about to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery, and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to be a degree.
When we end up talking to me and I was really happy to me, honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He took me up to the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
This is how my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even thought about my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says there are currently more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much of the number of Africans displaced during the entire slave of <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about <unk> <unk>
And yet, today you can enslaving entire families for generations for 300 <unk> dollars.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits by 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work in order to find that they are forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but who produce them are disposable people.
<unk> exists in almost the world, and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange strange show was like entering the ancient Egypt or <unk> <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 C. men, women, children, in fact, families <unk> in a heavy nucleus <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee <unk> or to drink, and the severe <unk> I would make it <unk> quite <unk>
And so <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera was too warm on it, and she stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the equipment and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> Don't do it here."
And it explained to me so clearly that I demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship from that country.
I could put them in a worst situation that they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for his release and trusted him to get it.
As soon as I was expecting to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids carrying rocks for miles per <unk> <unk> to trucks waiting for the <unk>
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge their heads and the kids <unk> their heads and their heads made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of them don't even know that they're slaves and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, they cut their own home.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> <unk> women who had been previously previously diagnosed with sex.
It led to me by a little bit of <unk> <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local.
They have small rooms -- private rooms, where <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of just seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a <unk> number in the wall, divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a acute <unk> fear of <unk> and at that instant, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> on the stairs where they <unk>
There was no gates <unk>
There was no big windows like <unk>
These people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point that slavery, even the sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in the agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often associate with the labor of <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were full families <unk> in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
<unk> black hands are the father, and the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and install silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
So still we hope to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
There are more than 4,000 children in the Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to look fast.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family in a boat, two older brothers -- some younger kids, some of the younger kids.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families, <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> which his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling in the water.
<unk> branches of trees <unk> in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and <unk> is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working since the last one.
On the cold night and <unk>
And I can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village in fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi is possible.
Who will be because of somebody who decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> on a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his coma, suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to do it for a land road to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out of quickly.
And then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started going down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking near an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as they <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> I ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit into a football, and everybody filled with <unk> workers.
Many women had children tied to their backs and, while they were looking for gold, <unk> in icy waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells are going to be 90 feet and these people carry with these little stone bags of stone that then they'll be transported to another area where they would <unk> the stone to get the gold out.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to them, on the margin we see working at other fortunate and also children.
All victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
When his uncle, <unk> inherit the debt of the uncle that will be a slave to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the 14 years and the lesion of the leg you see here is a product of a crash in <unk> so severe the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work night and day on that mine.
Even so, he has to be released and educated for local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to an remote, remote, which inspires me so much respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to find testimony of them and we will make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They are people -- real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's not one day that I will not think about these many beautiful people, <unk> I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that force turns into a fire and that <unk> light about slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math and there is a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> we are like management programs.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  we'll see later on.
But the train demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill, and probably some initial <unk> <unk> can be a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's as Parkinson's disease -- gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous <unk>
In the last few years, it's made a lot in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the movement is not <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological test.
So you have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of clinical trials, we never do it. It's never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if the patients could do the test these ourselves?
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to think about -- as a conventional shape for a try, you see, in a sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it makes sounds at the talk, we can imagine it as dancers from a rubber ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes need it, for example.
And like <unk> it requires a extraordinary training level.
Think about time that takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal vocal strings as <unk> and as Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it affects the <unk> organs.
In the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of a rough shake of string <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and lived after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> They both use existing infrastructure.
We don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but also the tests based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're very minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce our patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could make massive <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it is too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we are releasing the Parkinson's <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or without Parkinson's or without Parkinson's -- you can call it at a price and I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.    Tom Rielly: And so I <unk> taking all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who they are healthy and who not?
What are you going to take out of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease, TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> You may not have it.
But we're going to get a very big show of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors in pursuit of the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a precision <unk> at this time?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my student, <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now he has shown that it works on mobile phone network, too, what the project. Now the project. We have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I did <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were going through the dark, on <unk> rooms and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin -- even more perfect -- we do the impossible, all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March March 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, a organization where I was <unk> there was a place where I was <unk> there was the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a small village of fishermen located in the <unk> of <unk> from almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by wave.
The water level of water reached over 24 feet away and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools -- we took the mud and we left the <unk> and we leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of dead fish and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk>
We love and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and <unk> and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
They <unk> and take them to different places in the villages around them.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were complaining about the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help track a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the <unk> the enormous, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> center, <unk> the photos.
There were the honor of that day and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until far as I was my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that they had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and knowing that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as you have the <unk>
Over the step of time, they got a lot more pictures and they needed more <unk> so that I went back into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries offered to help.
At two weeks, I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we brought us to <unk> a neighbor town in northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of temporary <unk> that had <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could make an hour an hour or a few weeks ago.
I could make months months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much hand using a guide and the areas that the color and the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures submerged in water covered in water covered by bacteria, even with <unk> everything along with time with time continue to <unk> it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean and dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt the photos even more <unk>
As he said once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was fortunate to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> she was stopped but stopped realizing that they would get them even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not be <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture, and then put it the whole picture.
When you picked their photos shared some of his history with us.
A young colleagues in her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble too far from where he used to be their house, but their colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Your little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find his whole family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his photographs his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that I could <unk> something that he could remember the past that had not been marked on the past day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there and <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean over <unk> photographs -- the great majority of them became their hands of their <unk>
Over 500 volunteers all over the world helped us bring over to 90 families and completely <unk> and <unk>
Over this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We took pictures constantly.
One picture is a memory memory or something, one thing, a relationship, someone loved it.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would give us but the first thing that we would take to look for.
This is about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this, you get back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that the <unk>
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger -- I'll bring something, using his talent to something that are not thin thin skin.
I want to finish this email you would like to read this electronic email that I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture with women of different ages from grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter just <unk> hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few our basic needs -- right?
Thank you. 
And <unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition in one one-millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a thousand billion, but a billion per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos on a slow camera of light on motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> of the vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it down and I would turn it up and put it into a second <unk> or it means a number of <unk> to create a snippet of photons just a millimeter ago.
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet does.
If we take that bullet and this little photons of photons and <unk> it into this bottle, how do those photons freeze inside this <unk>
What is the light aspect of light on <unk>
Now, all of this --   remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes on to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light on motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to make this research --  -- <unk> many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a little bit of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come into the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the <unk> of the top of the bottle, after several boxes, that the <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a common and ordinary bullet and we make it going down the same distance and we see it on slow motion, to about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us to see that film?
One day?
It would be a very boring movie -- from a slow movie on motion.
And what about testing nature <unk>
You can see the waves of the table, the tomato <unk> and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of light.
But if you look at this <unk> you realize that, as the light gets <unk> from <unk> they still keep <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside your inner and it goes out of several <unk> in a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in their mobile phone, you can be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera in MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture to the exhibition, it goes very little light.
But we will be going to be a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so that I could barely go into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded one and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw data and make it interesting ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could just throw some light on the door. And then you enter the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and that's going to reflect on the camera.
Where we could get those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We've already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera but interestingly, slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It's very good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what extent it corresponds to a distance.
So by projecting a laser you can record a picture in Hindi, that you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of pictures, and we will try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our rebuilding
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going around on the curve.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at the light of the open windows on the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite difficult, so this is actually a question for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality <unk> to solve the problems of mammography in the next generation.
So as a <unk> <unk> -- it became a scientist, it turned science in art, an art of photographs of <unk>
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collect every time is not just for scientific data:
And to create a new form of computational photography with slow camera and color code.
And let's look at those waves -- remember, the time between each one of those waves is only about <unk>
But here's something fun here.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are leaving us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order that the events occur in the world sometimes comes into the camera.
<unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and gives you free freedom.
With a mobile phone you can <unk> a crime against humanity on Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, and you can record it to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that time, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. So imagine if all of these people gathering that <unk> in search for a change, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who would have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's very much. They almost all have a cell now.
But today I'm going to talk about my cellphone, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the devastation of the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
And this will say that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls centuries. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All this data is stored for at least six months, and even two years, in his phone company or his Internet <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers.
There were lawyers, journalists, who said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0
The <unk> was the secret police in East Germany.
And I also wondered if this works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time, I was the largest telephone company in Germany, which by please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to get a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end of it <unk>
They demand the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> 30 percent of information.
At first I saw him, and I said, well, it's a huge archive right.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to do that.
I want to make it a <unk>
Because I want to show people what the <unk> means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open Global City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can get closer and go, go back and forwards.
You can see every step I want to do.
And you can see how I'm going to go on the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call me between them.
And then you call the other one, and the other one on the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other to what time they call each other to do is what time they call people to go to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to whom, who sent an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this data is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone <unk>
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who was the leaders, this never had happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you come home to home to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and not just fashion.
When you go home, <unk> his representative that just because businesses and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your company phone company, what should you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to give them to remember they have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello others, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello others, what happens?
I call <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother, and not the <unk> because my parents were cousins, brothers, though they are.
Just happen by accidents, like the one that came to me at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you -- I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of us in this room.
It feels bad for me, because at some time in life, you've wanted to be disabled to be disabled.
Let's go on a walk.
Christmas Christmas, they're at the mall, driving in circles in search of parking lot, and what do you see?
16 different places for disabled.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C is only one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would get the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> woman, and I am <unk> and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm in Yellowstone <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk my home to New York, I can do it.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents would join the school system and get bored with the school system, and if we wouldn't take any of the maximum note all of the <unk> all of my mother.
My father taught me to walk the age of five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another breakthrough that was using was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion which has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> as a <unk>
The people I grew up with had no trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed like a lot of <unk> that died from hunger during the <unk>
I told them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating it, so that <unk> from dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to pass the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I was spending my summers out of a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the way to Palestine all the <unk> <unk> us.
On summer vacation often my father tried to <unk> so I could drink milk from <unk> so I could drink <unk> milk in the back, I was holding into the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I was doing yoga was a <unk> comedian that I could not stand <unk> <unk>
And I can do it in your head.
My parents would have this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of the state of Arizona, because I went into all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> with the theater department.
So all of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo of <unk> my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> I will have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end of them, we end up.
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running into the CEO of the theater, crying as if someone had killed my cat, asking her why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the risk stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a piece of paper that literally had been born and they gave it to an actor.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors for disabled.
And I learned back home, and my first tour <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it was there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was evident to me that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's just <unk> to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
On my first tour, he took comic comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that he was at high speed on the highway <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, not censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know they never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and rather than remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
We talked to Arabs was much easier to fight the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went as invited to the news program that has Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I was at a graduate dance, I went back to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I wrapped up at the desk that was not going to get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they would not get me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but he was sort of <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned on direct Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that kids are <unk> but it never would have a little girl or no girl.
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips on line with a <unk> like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested I even would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The disability is so visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make it <unk> then they can't make someone on a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
But if we have grown up with the media, I don't think I <unk>
I hope that together we could create more positive images of disability in media and everyday lives.
Maybe if there were more positive images that we would have more hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need all the society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to some very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> at the middle of New Jersey state in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> <unk> a charity to give children Palestinian refugee -- a tiny part of what my parents would come in.
It was the only time my father saw me acting in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This town is about <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunities, there's no work, no <unk>
He has just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year we had nothing.
One day you talk about a guy who offers him to take him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
It meets a <unk> group of people, who gives it a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new money to buy their new money to send your family.
You present a young young.
They finally go home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a single blue sky <unk> a bomb car.
That boy of that little town with dreams of the great city was the terrorist terrorist <unk> and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a connected terrorist organization with the Qaeda.
So how does the story of a little boy in a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he came out.
This was the first thing that took him from what we call the period of <unk>
And his story repeats in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed city that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from the highest unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't afford opportunities, the story of the <unk> the door of access to violence, to <unk> to be the history of embryonic cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital <unk> the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, "Well, if I never had gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some youth leaders at a business force.
It was about 90 young leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had one rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he was a college student, <unk> frustrated, who was a college student, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect perfect for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle for the point B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have destroyed completely the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of bikes for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does it do about this <unk>
I think his ability to identify and take a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think business can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
And we would teach young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to make a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from overseas.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk>
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> that as he said, they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding and creating gardens in the houses, and the businesses in the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk>
There is no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young families, can go together, and like he says, smell the roses <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but his story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
They provide business solutions for local problems.
So inspiring young people and creating a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to <unk> in development and put on their businesses.
They would teach young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her <unk> of <unk> this is how it calls it, when it is created, and then transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> hired the street to help rent and keep the bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the paralysis of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young in the children in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in upstate New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it's not going to be on the way that we would <unk> we could almost pretend we were the first human beings in advance that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with view of a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with <unk> apple hearts -- aluminum balls, and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy as to pull out what they thought they were going to clean their <unk>
That question went on with me, and I got a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how they <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who clean our garbage in <unk>
Who clean our junk in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and <unk> tons of waste and <unk> tons of <unk>
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his trajectories and interviewed people in office and facilities in all town, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
He needed to go even more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks.
And operated up the mechanical ones and the snow bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
Everybody asks the smell.
It's there, but it's not as skilled as you believe it, and in the days that it is very strong you will be paid quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were kept <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the waste collection is one of the world's most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and they go around around you.
You just want to do it, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also, the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about how it is <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature in itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always should be on motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important piece of work on the streets of town, for three reasons.
They're the first license of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of how efficient and effective <unk> every day, this starts to <unk> their containers and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
Disease we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start <unk> and begin to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we have no space for what the drivers of economics start to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just set up his relationship.
And then there is what I call our average <unk>
And with that, I mean just at the speed of the use that we used to move in the little <unk>
We're usually not allowed to <unk> and we have to take it up with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that it was going to come up with.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about waste collection that may help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her job, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, in the street every day.
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always has to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste waste on the street, grabbed my son, <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and said, "We're going to be okay.
Are we going to be good."
Shortly after that I started to investigate waste and went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we got good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species we have to include and have in account all the costs -- even the very real human cost of labor.
The city waste -- what we think when we talk about garbage represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable ritual.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next to see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
Let's get a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on the connection to think about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects in recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> mall in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that we showed us as an example, and my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city -- many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> carries heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this should not happen because it's about the temperate of 20 to 25 degrees during all the year.
And third, it looks like nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a worthwhile place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really held with the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
That's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the side of the site, which is located in a very much growth zone in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not yet.
And it's also between two parallel streets that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the entries from the building.
And this extends with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space in free air in the building that would spread through its own shape, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric like a concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me to model the <unk>
We are building that with these little <unk> pieces, which are the windows that drop the air and light in a way of the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas it was not easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It was not what I <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center of the mall because there was more local to sell.
And in addition to the idea of the facade it was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we used to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity cuts down almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the ceiling as a new public space with areas of gathering areas that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, set up water in the inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a set of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big, big project, the bigger that I have, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put attention into the <unk> a <unk> <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen doors of access to almost straight.
When I went into the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets, creating 12 initial blocks similar to size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some strategic points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this makes it alter the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best counseling for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So it <unk> a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density at higher levels and a lower density in the plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community the whole space of the building space by construction.
It's where all the neighbors can go up and <unk> and make activities such as a race of two miles per morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach in design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people change into communities and local economies at the same rate that grow the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of very bright hair and a little bit of <unk> little pencils and it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I was able to get my sinister life involved.
One day I got a time after the way out of school, I was a little afternoon and I hid in the bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher <unk>
And then I did.
I would take the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
And I set up to bring the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all over the rows of <unk> and myself a row of that, just for being there, because I <unk>
I'm still amazed at what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I have never been <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I will never come up.
But above all, I was telling me the reason I was annoyed that this little girl was so good for <unk>
Would the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
The primates. The <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one because of children's killings in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
And so you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab where they study <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy <unk> would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
I would have no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without others, there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers to everything, and in terms of them, most of them have all of them.
This year is now 100 years of the masterpiece, "In the <unk> study for the <unk> -- the most sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that picture.
We forgot how exquisite it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as tough as <unk>
I don't know how it is <unk> <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the individuals, that you cut into the person, to desire, to their wish, are a good narrative base <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel ideas, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being a storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details <unk> to <unk> the knife isn't it?
<unk> are doing all novelists and that's something I wanted to understand.
All she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to be true of himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> it senses in his lover -- adds up to his collection of <unk> instruments in your private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big amounts of hair and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> were <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links to the language <unk> with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of color, of soon listening behind the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then they deny those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an ancient text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> are looking <unk> and they make it seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they're looking for the truth, really, really painful. In fact, to what <unk> <unk> the better the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways on the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, who makes us suffer, that makes us suffer, that causes a lot deeper and vital man than a wise man that can be <unk>
It's telling us that let's go for <unk> women.
No. I think he's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There is some other emotion to us, our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look like <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being used with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud says that there was something strange about that man, who didn't get <unk> in what his wife did.
So she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, she did his wife, not to see it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or not accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
The novels described very well how the <unk> are going to look like <unk> but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, the more we become growing together.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of illegal <unk>
<unk> makes us behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself for eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story I heard about the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since they would send messages to himself, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to get it to the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to tell you that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
What enormous does creativity.
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books who are trying to do about how individuals, confused our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of ours, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> at a moment.
Take Tom <unk> his greatest character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to get to you from your self and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the <unk> floor, it takes your <unk> cow your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route from Tom <unk>
I can't give you the whole world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when you're not safe, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal.
But I've always said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius.
Oh, so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once they <unk> <unk> <unk> to all with his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And it tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> that I don't want to give you the hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> transferred in history. I think this is very emotional -- right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next one is the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being <unk>
It might still be so good?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to stop the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> the scary thing -- Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21 of July in July Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the coat of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea, <unk>
Armstrong and <unk> were themselves, but their presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the greatest time in peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of day today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo led to a 400,000 people and asked 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
They died people, including <unk> <unk>
But before the Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, which was focused on the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because the Kennedy President wanted to demonstrate the <unk> that this nation was better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. Tell me some ask, why does it <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And they might also ask, why scale the most <unk> mountain.
So 35 years ago, why will we fly about <unk>
Why plays the Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the <unk> was not just a victory of West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> in the way of the powers of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to do it.
The landing was in a context of a long context of technological <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they <unk> the <unk> and we eliminated smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
During most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a <unk> or a ship, but in 1969, the crew <unk> crew flew 40,000 miles / time.
Since 1970s, no human being has become the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism of technology about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems we imagine that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create clean energy, cure cancer or feed the world's population seem to have been <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't get to the escape <unk> <unk> of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So what that happens, it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard this for the two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists had <unk> and they had enriched with trivial toys -- things like <unk> apps and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which they would <unk> Intel Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are guilty, in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists offer the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk led to the creation of ideas that are given for the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly going wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about risk, they preferred little investment investment, which they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is all over the long term. They have never invested in the development of technologies dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have a real commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and the oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want alternative sources of alternative energy that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties <unk> the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant rise in research and development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there's no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy policy of America or international treaties who reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big issues that looked like technology, are not going to be.
We know it for a time that famines are a result of failure in food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are crisis policies that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the harvest or the systems for the storage and exchange for food, but there will be there as bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon president declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many types of cancer -- some terribly resilient people in the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective and effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have to do that, but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support <unk> must be really a <unk> problem, and we have to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve great problems, it serves with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition, like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, I'll go to the moon turned simple.
It was only three days.
And really, I didn't even find any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas that are <unk>
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a very big decline in trust, is a very general statement.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, that I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why people think trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And it turns out to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions that might have increased in others.
I don't have clear.
But I can turn to the polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at coffee surveys over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable 20 years ago, they still have a lot of <unk> but nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway along the way.
But this is this evidence for enough?
What study opinion surveys are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What they look at is the <unk> attitudes that people believe when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> at <unk> teachers.
You probably want to ask, "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some people, but in other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to make confidence.
We don't think that the level of trust that we're going to feel like a certain type of official official, and it's going to be uniform in all of those cases.
I could, for example, I trust a certain teacher of elementary school I know to give the kind of high school, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in the more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they try to do the good business judgment to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's stupid.
This is not the goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not <unk>
And I think that those people who are doing their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart objective in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> that is the right target.
Once you say it, he says, yeah, yeah, it means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to do a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if you find that a person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in the contrary, they're not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that they would have their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If you do this, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is what we're going to do is that we are going to think about it before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions for all sorts of professional career officials and so forth, who made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the design <unk> which will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the accountability system that is destined to ensure the <unk> and <unk> evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You may have all of you know similar examples.
They put all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were going to be worthy of the confidence and they would encourage people that we are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people or politicians or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the <unk> which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
It takes the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
Can we rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they are two people together, trying to improve confidence.
But the trust, ultimately, it's shallow because they give us the other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the passwords enough to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to bring ourselves a clue that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
It takes every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> <unk>
I take them and give me the money, or change it for the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how else is that the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of the computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly more and more and more and more, to such that today, it's less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I wouldn't have <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
I first created this tool that goes back into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen <unk> its physical body to the pixel itself.
Designers can take their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the skill of your hands?
In the journal of Science <unk> from Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and turned a little space on the keyboard in a digital field of work.
It was a transparent bombsight with identical cameras to detect their fingers and face, now you can lift your hands out of the keyboard, getting inside of the 3D space and grab pixels right with your hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can go through the book and step lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down in every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
So many of us will have been bought and <unk> things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make it physical to be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel on it.
This imam <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this tiny three-dimensional space.
We <unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when we program digitally the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and come back to reproduce and they are always in the physical world.
You can teach physically <unk> and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality of the things that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's fascinating to change the physics physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us to have us from our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to get a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed that there was only one way in <unk> path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I want it or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to school.
I had to wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio show.
But no adult would make it the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends -- but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So this was the age of 15 years, I knew I was too much older to train.
My dream never <unk>
And so I think that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about human <unk> life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but you'd miss it.
That's one thing for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave rise to my habit of reading <unk>
<unk> many perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what the students in China should learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map means the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all the research fields like collaborative comparative and academic literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading is worked for research, why not do it as well in <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two.
You can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> instead of losing in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up to me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used or powerless ever.
Having a dream <unk> is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
His most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where the passion comes from.
Even a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that today I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> I threw on the couch my office took my shoes off, and he told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My fellow class had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex <unk> to the <unk> was made me easy to move his head while we would bring the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I saw her was right.
You start to work after that, then she has kids later, until the death later.
By the way, as Alex and I had time to make it.
But a little bit later, my <unk> invited me to press a talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Yes, it's coming up with guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe you get married with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this did not make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of grave benign was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody gets to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're unbelievable.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take the dream of a <unk> you take the dream of a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give us a form of life for when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> people are not <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it is <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change themselves, now is the time to change themselves.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top of 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> over their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the kid, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily life and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called the adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what they are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes at the line of time from <unk>
Researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
The journalists told him, <unk> names of <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think about when they give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It's not happening.
They stole that person the urgency of urgency and his ambition and it's absolutely nothing.
And then every day -- smart intelligent, interesting things like you or your children come into my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't notice. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before the 30, everything will be OK."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better driver the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They all ran up and <unk> but then at some time around the 30, the music turned the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds like a little bit extreme, but not <unk> the risks are very high.
So when you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure by 30 and so many of them started a career, choosing a city, and have two or three children in a long period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that you start to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis crisis is not about buying electric cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You see, you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give your child to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was doing? What was he thinking?"
I want to change what they are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
The 25, she came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or entertainment, but it still wasn't allowed to decide, so I spent the last years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper -- I was living with a boyfriend that showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though they live a lot of <unk> very difficult, his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then it gets up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day she got his head on his legs and cried for almost the entire time.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then it was looking at the empty space that followed by <unk> for <unk> please call <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I wouldn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
It needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as the decade <unk> of Emma was going on.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that <unk> from that crisis of identity and <unk> of identity.
By identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates identity capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration -- I am <unk> the exploration that you shouldn't count, but by the way, it's not <unk>
It's <unk>
I told Emma how to explore jobs and make them tell.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the surprise that they get together with friends with the similar minds limit how to know what you know about, how do you talk about, how to talk about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who was going to come out almost always comes from its closest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak <unk> friends of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half is not, and the weak links are the way we get to this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way we get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how the information is happening.
For last but not less important, she believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as he was <unk> she was soon going to come back to his family when she has a couple and form her own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choice to the person who you live right now, or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook starts to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so <unk> in love as you're in work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it going to work or kill time with anyone who will be <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate from a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That work of work gave her a reason to leave the <unk>
Now, five years later, it's special <unk> of events in museums.
This married with a man who chose <unk>
I had their new career, he loves his new family, and I sent myself a letter that said, "Now the spaces of hospital contacts are not <unk>
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming from Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in their trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or the 25 and even the <unk> a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the next generation.
This is my idea worth spreading all the <unk> that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day, <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity capital, and you get their <unk> and use their weak <unk>
They don't want to define why they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very expensive job management in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to show you mathematics to <unk> students in New York City.
And as any teacher, I pick up testing and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When I went back, I went down grades.
What I called me attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance, have no scores of I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things you need to learn in seventh grade, safe, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and convinced that every single one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I got to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to university to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who has a success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in very, very difficult neighborhoods, what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and from <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning outcomes of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, ask yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their own work?
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good look, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
The determination is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the week, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my determination questionnaires and then waited about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when they put them into every feature that I could measure, the family income, the results of the <unk> tests, even security that the kids felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> National <unk> which matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for the <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know how little the science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we develop the determination in the children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job ethic in work?
How do I keep her motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the wrong determination is not related or even related to the measurements of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University at Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not any phenomenon that can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows into response to the challenge, they're much more prone to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a big idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, <unk> to start everything again with the lessons of <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It looks like the Great Wall Wall
In the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated <unk>
I started thinking about how a new method and rapid learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, just enough to read traffic traffic signals from <unk> to understand the basic idea of the website or the paper.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might possibly be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if they were shouting at a <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door symbol looks like a couple of <unk> in the old west.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
These are building blocks to create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If one person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a bug like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> from remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two two: it becomes very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes over the horizon.
One door. Put a chart inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> got somebody at home?
This person is coming hidden from one door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women -- they're <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth's Sun.
This is a sun placed with the <unk> because Japan is in the east of China.
So one sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked recursively.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where you go out and get a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician together.
The film is his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic parent.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and bring our kids into a kind of complex child's <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took up 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal kid and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl in the <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician will do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat the military generated by the computer of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made Star <unk> for a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Just three years.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of supervision had been <unk>  And so they turned into the room and sat down in the room and was struck as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
So the sense that Luke was one military to <unk> the government?
Let's get this with the magician of <unk>
How does it make Dorothy his movie?
They are doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, right? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much tax devices in the movies for our children, and so little of the road to <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that had served me to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss that was really expected to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My quest is done, I have a girlfriend.
Why still stand there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like for being a kid, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though them, are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job when teaching girls how to defend them, they don't necessarily show kids how to defend themselves from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and charming as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
And of course, the most successful theme of all time continues to come up with classic and a little child in a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who bred a child.
And so far as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Remember what the criticism said when he went out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie from a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it let you.
Well, almost none of these films is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you heard about this.
It's still not slowing upside down, but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a book of comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the <unk> of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> in the film, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk about each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than you like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things to each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success from <unk> a sense of consensus about what a Hollywood movie film.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the Internet crisis.
We have many scenes from men who have deep deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists who are <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women who have chosen recently for Congress, so it's fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he was saying.
One in the United States, one in five women says that it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I think music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they do not <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools in our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> -- whether at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role that you care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what he was from Star Trek <unk> you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress in it.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people in order to get their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where his job looked like it is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a kid, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I loved was to look at the sea shores on the Maine, because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was terrified of <unk>
I started seeing ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, had grown up to one of almost 1,300 miles from length and <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see using <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern <unk> <unk> called <unk>
And the place, just seems to be brown but when we use the infrared and process using fake, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes in the <unk> landscape by building materials and the ancient Egyptians of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find a <unk> city called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge, it's about <unk> per mile away.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed the time, moved on the whole city, covered all the city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find them at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with <unk> eyes, and using baseball.
So we use NASA NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, that we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians doing <unk> <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like you take it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation for human occupation there.
Five meters down, under a dense layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of objects in ceramics.
This means that in this location of <unk> five meters down the bottom, we have a layer of <unk> from several hundred years to date back to the Middle Empire and exactly the same period we think is <unk>
We also found jobs of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> <unk>
This might seem like not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop, which shows that what I've been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we would go back to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire -- probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to this, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas were really started in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the pursuit of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door to <unk> home.
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> <unk> and they're going to address their doorstep.
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide from the door to their house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere -- wheels go on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in places -- <unk> the threshold of the door.
And the <unk> in the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and watch the light of light. The light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that he's talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> taking them on your nose.
You can smell the cookie cookie and you go to you that it's about to go into the mouth.
They went on one side and you enter their living room.
In the room, and making it maximum use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on his middle <unk> singing <unk> <unk> <unk> More <unk>
Now <unk> to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a side of yellow bricks and from the oven, come to you <unk> Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, I was playing, I suppose, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of these different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, look at them just once.
They have the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
We ate whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be a phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and have one of the best memories of <unk>
And I said, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miracle acts of memory using some ancient techniques invented by ancient techniques invented in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their speeches -- and the <unk> <unk> used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How does it not have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English one, even though a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how do you memorize the order in a deck of <unk> in national TV.
That will show you the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the start of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what can their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window to allow us to see what our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> and he was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went back together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, I had a number of treaties on the memory written about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory and disciplined and <unk> and <unk> was not a very rare thing as it can look like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we also have changed.
They have changed it, and I would say that they've also changed the cognitive as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it looks like we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is this unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College in London invited a memory memory group in the lab.
They wanted to know about, it will be that it has brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're smarter than <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference in the brains of memory champions and the issues of issues of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI MRI machine, <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory of memory <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or looked at them -- a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The <unk> tournament is driving as a armed race where each year appears to be a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors should have a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just him <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the order of <unk> digits <unk>
It's on half hour.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things about these competence, absolutely all the techniques that are used by the end of the end is cut down to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I get later, and I ask them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you do?"
The person who told the name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity. That's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance over his head.
But the word <unk> we know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have flour in your hands.
They were fine when they come home to work.
Probably a <unk>
And when you put that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to make this over two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet named <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring it to a <unk> they would get <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up with me, <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and so soon it was, the hall of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the <unk> bodies to <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't afford it <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, shut my eyes, and I realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single bit.
I took the family family <unk> where they were their loved ones in the rubble.
What you have noticed at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good to remember names or numbers or instructions or the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and extraordinary spatial memory.
If you ask them to tell me that I would give you the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you tell them to say who I was sitting on the horse any brown speaker in his <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember. The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from memory, in the same way that would have made it <unk> if they had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And we will come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth thing they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
So this is how speakers <unk> <unk> their speeches -- not word for word, which is going to confuse it's typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his memory memory.
I saw that this was just exciting and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition.
So seriously, it's like seeing a bunch of people sitting taking together and I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to wear her place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or was the names of an ancient school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was really fun.
I would never have expected to get it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's really about doing is to make it better and more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was hooked pretty close with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some of the safety glasses with tape leaving just two <unk> because the score is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> <unk>
I thought this could be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I had to happen.
Of course, it's nice power to memorize speeches and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because it's based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build the memory of the memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insight into how their mind works.
Often we talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We <unk> when we focus on.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
We have a deep sort of deep processing kind of processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not going to go down there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
This is how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what I would do -- I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to human being in front of us, who walks our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even focus on processing <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are some incredible <unk> capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a lifetime -- you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we would take it just a place -- New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, me I was six years old, and I lived there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my room and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everyone was looking at TV -- so every time I was out of my room to the bathroom, all of me looked at me, and every time I stood up, and I would wrapped up in a towel, I all see me.
And I was like this.
It was hard and not, and I hated it.
You know, that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about mathematics, it's not about mathematics, and it's about those emotional connections that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would tell you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it by based on a building two 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> in front of the sea.
This is very, very useful, because building things is frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that you know that they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Public Library -- which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this very short thing, columns, brick red, that they leave <unk> what we are trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished -- which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of equipment for the city, a place to meet up, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, are so different.
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new new solutions for today's life forms today.
We were going to go back and do it so much, we get away from the people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you believe that we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We need to go to the other side and go back to these <unk> symbols to connect with these <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, so we started to experience <unk> we can swing the backwards backwards and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 300 years.
Well, 30 years ago from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Something really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We took those ways that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added <unk> and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> and we turned it in charge, that can be <unk> <unk> facts.
The shapes are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend in commercial malls we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian one.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to symbols.
They're easy. They're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we can create memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a little bit of ways that would be <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when I <unk> academics and public and general, they were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times newspaper.
The tourism in Bilbao increased by 2.5 percent when the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Los Angeles, <unk> New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how can these <unk> <unk> and <unk> how it might be possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media will spread around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the main mayors in the world.
So they all believed if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of new millennials went with another star.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through with all of architecture. The digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
Road <unk> can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It's not very accurate enough to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design 2, eight, or 100 buildings, before we know if the one that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't about two years old, it's 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to be going back to <unk> because we're in the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the <unk> of steel or <unk> and it is the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the creation of communication, it starts to swing increasingly faster, until we get to be in both extreme extremes in <unk> and they actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, with us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community -- and as the drawings looked exactly the product, and there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get and shared in social media, the building stopped being only a building, it became a building, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that one made the building.
And as you use it to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative and that makes it part of the collective narrative -- and when you carry these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building is built today, the Internet is looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> you can bring the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no answer to what a library can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This wealth of solutions gives the freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and drawings, and one is not a <unk> audience that doesn't support before.
architects can listen, and you're not allowed to vote for architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, about movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick based on ideas of what a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for ways that will produce.
That means that buildings will become <unk> of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve a sport or to <unk> or even you get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream in the East <unk> East in New York, and raise half a million dollars from the community together.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion so <unk> and <unk> as animals are going to observe.
Because no longer matters if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built what we build.
We architects know how to make more and more <unk> and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not at the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings don't only reflect our society, but they give us a way to the most <unk> spaces -- the local libraries where we form our children, and the <unk> in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this very cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
They were laughing and <unk> and it gives himself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he made me think, when did you want to do this?
How is it all of a sudden we're not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are seeking to Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old, and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week at school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time she was beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
What his mom says to him and what your friends, or fellow colleagues say, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her himself, publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to leave a <unk> "Am I <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 a.m.
Some of these are so <unk> they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal teenager who gets these answers in one of the stages of their most politically emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly girls trying to communicate this way.
But what are they doing this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking to you: <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> this never ends.
Never before we have never been so connected in a violent way of <unk> so young.
As a mother said, "It's like a party in your room all <unk>
There's no privacy.
And social pressures on the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the types of comments that they do.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is motivated to.
What is the main thing about someone in front of someone in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news for girls now.
<unk> <unk> still <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people look like?
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> superheroes of sport, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow up healthy individuals and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and effort to work to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and as they choose to society and the developing field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the classroom, <unk> participate in the classroom, because they don't want to call attention for their physical thinking.
One of five are not going to classes at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you're looking at good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin, <unk> a lower note from the average of your fellow who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has spread in Finland, America and China.
And it gives them regardless of what these young people are.
So to be good of sure, we're talking about how you see yourself not from how you look like.
The low self-esteem on his body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with <unk> <unk> are less physical activity -- eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet than they can bring them to a food disorder.
They have low self-worth.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we thought it's all about this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview on a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
It was a interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways -- the first one is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our adolescents to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-worth.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs never realize it, <unk>
So we need to make sure that the program is still going to have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that best programs focus on six key areas, the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six things are starting to be critical for anybody willing to provide body education to make it work.
A education is a <unk> but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue, and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians on <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people for what they are, not as you see.
All of us can begin by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time I had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and businesses, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow up all their person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
And let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out in the big screen, because only we can create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think you can never see the <unk> of being who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
Her <unk>
It might be simply the woman who is at two seats. What would it mean for her if it was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, which he <unk> it was not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a more <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to take this out and make sure of his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are getting up all of us.
But let's try our children the truth.
So the way you see that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and because they make us feel.
They would encourage self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year age today, becoming agents of security agents in themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
The top of November November 1990, a guy named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
At <unk> initially they were innocent but being prisoner by other charges -- in the company of others, they started planning for about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Luckily those plans would come into an FBI informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center, you couldn't avoid.
He later <unk> would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving mother, an American school teacher in the two made all possible to give me a happy childhood,
Just when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, which very few, even most Muslims, they get to meet.
And so I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to have the same things in life.
However, in all religion -- all over human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible media for everybody lived as them.
A few months before he arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekend, he and some friends had been going to training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> shooting <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got my father -- my father helped me support the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet who shot I gave up the little orange light on the goal and, for all, especially me, all of me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
From such a father, as a child.
And all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But only a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later, they would be convicted by putting a little bit of <unk> pounds of explosives in the underground parking parking lot in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had already moved 20 times. That instability in my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was a moment of packing and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret is my identity to avoid being the white. But it's going to be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was telling me to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences they put together my way to think, was during presidential presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I participated in the National Convention <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt very much.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids had done friendship, was Jewish age.
It took several days to come out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
Never before I had had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having to overcome the barrier that all life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I met people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All the life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be the <unk> but I know what it is to be kind of <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every evening, Jon Stewart was making me honest about my <unk> and helping me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that conserving my heart forever, while she's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who's suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside of it.
My name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put me in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else is trying to bring it to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way -- that even though I was scared to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and because of their loved ones, and the loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk against those acts of meaningless acts, as rejection of my father.
With this <unk> I put in this <unk> as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that kids don't have to follow their parents on their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this moment there is a film that is projected in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> movie.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell, taste and texture.
Do you feel your body, your grief, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a few moments of your childhood that project myself to your eyes.
And it is constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in it.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, your own you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know that I have an <unk>
I'm not sure you're aware of yourself.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk> films.
Why are we not just the robots that we have to get to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Science in nature, is objective one.
Consciousness is subjective for nature, it's subjective stuff.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, <unk> that vision.
<unk> was studying <unk> behavior, the neuroscience was <unk> but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
It was like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for the science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The core of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something of this guy in the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of looking faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what it is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to the <unk>
There is no easy problem with consciousness.
So it is not stepping up the true central mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a <unk> <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do you work <unk> how are we <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how we work.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about, how we speak, how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions of behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why is that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still don't have much to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that will work. For a long time, I hit my head against a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that will work.
But at the end I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to get that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of Muslim <unk> before dealing with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
And his crazy idea is that there's no such a hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the <unk> subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of <unk> the behaviors of the brain, and this is what it needs to <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely unified consciousness theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that left -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
So physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a fundamental bricks -- space, time and mass.
We have fundamental laws that <unk> them as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of no more basic terms.
On the contrary, you think about the world -- and it's built the world.
Sometimes the key list is going to be <unk>
In the 19th century <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- <unk> space, time, <unk> laws -- so I applied the basic laws of the <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- fundamental ideas, time, <unk> charge, then a matter of logic, there is that <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as something fundamental -- a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not the object of science, actually.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, the mass, the physical processes.
So physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can fit them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can do it in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called <unk> <unk> for everyone, every system is conscious, not only humans, or dogs, <unk> -- even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think -- always traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of raw feeling -- <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This might sound a little crazy for you.
How do you think something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is fundamental stuff.
If it's fundamental as space, time, and the mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more continuous with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with a mathematician.
It has a kind of math integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of integration of information, as meaningful of consciousness is quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is lower, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness from zero.
It made a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
So physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind the reality behind us.
As explains Stephen Hawking's where is the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not in the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential for <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical implications of it.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that has consciousness, so I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think that thinking about it well, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what it matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> it's not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask by consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information, integrated information, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they share some pretty serious ethical problems about the development of development of intelligent computer systems and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or on a local level, a group of integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, at this moment we have a TED consciousness -- a internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more secure from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is that it's universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love us.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will find it.
Understanding consciousness is the true key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village on Victoria.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I was scared with my friends, my little sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a problem evident.
She actually hasn't gotten anything.
I went to school, I had good grades. After the school, I had a <unk> profile in my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to get your <unk>
And I said, "What about <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheelchair, they talk about things like <unk> in the school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people as inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire them.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for them to be <unk> Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, you sold the lie that disability is a <unk> A capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not bad and you can't make it <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You might have seen one, of the girl without hands drawing with a pen held by his mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with blood fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn <unk> because we had a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabled people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of the number of times that they have been faced with, to express that you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my job had a public profile.
It was like if I was getting up in the morning, and I remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images that are linked to people with disability for people with no disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
We have some things.
But the things that we haven't passed on, are things that you can think about.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was faced with the social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society we live in terms of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
And the things I need to do, and I've learned how to do the best of their ability as you do, and that's what happens with kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you how a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything else.
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm lucky to them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall up --  <unk> the ingenious trick of how you can charge your cell phone battery into the battery battery.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a spinal cord has never done to become a <unk>
Never.    <unk> to a television screen will not make the subtitles for the <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> you don't think of anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be <unk> by <unk> and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the real achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a child from 11 grade school is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but to question what you believe to know about what you think about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football of the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think really <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know -- because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try and <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it's run by the game of play to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a <unk> man -- we were trying to <unk> it with all of his self.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So some videos to show you what it is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices practices because the idea of emerging technology is a submarine going up to the surface, but we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit of a moment. <unk> a little.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field from the perspective of the <unk>
You've got to realize that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go! Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to be in the field, but has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
You want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, will be their favorite players, and you have asked me on YouTube and you can see it from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many you know.
The Rift Court has been described as the most realistic virtual reality system ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God, Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian mountain <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> out of a <unk> with his arm before running and making a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> releasing the ball at the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will their experience are when you get a mountain to over 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> <unk> sales for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, virtual reality.
How do we achieve reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when the <unk> and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So here's a short review of technology in <unk> technology.
In 1965, the <unk> in Baltimore put a <unk> on his field <unk> so they would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl, that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, I put the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and then on the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that it's a player coming back to their group and you see their next role shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you are in front of you, you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or because of memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and get it.
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk> strategy.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera on every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from <unk> <unk> and <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information will send you to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
You might have information <unk>
This is <unk> to the good teams.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being alone to nerds.
It would also be for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that they are the field.
It was <unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to be <unk> not <unk> but the <unk> system will be <unk>
They went into the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open receiver here.
<unk> the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, however, the receptor sees the bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
They <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have been followed by each angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy in human beings, to show somebody what it is, literally, being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much is this technology worth in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how honest are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives to be <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or a Neil <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as always, as usual.
Thank you.
Recently I was <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
The majority of those 23 years -- the southern end of the <unk> County <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to rise by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a imam for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Golden <unk> was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer <unk> building the bridge said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two individual towers will bring it to another dimension, this bridge has <unk> as such, as such, you frees it out of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bone, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The ones that don't normally get into the <unk> water, and then they get away.
I don't think that the <unk> of this suicide method will realize the death of death to <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people have to get away from their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darkest time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year as this young man was talking with an official watching his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had successful that day to bring it back over the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
It was going to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22 percent of the year when I was getting a call from a possible subject of a <unk> subject sitting in the pitch near the center.
<unk> and when I arrived, he looked at Jason talking to Jason was a official Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up to this two times before from New Jersey to try to eat from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and he did.
This kind of kind of clever guy in New Jersey had just taken away from life.
I talked to the parents of Jason -- that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the doctor was called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had asked him.
<unk> damage from suicide affect a lot of people.
I put these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do you think?
So what does it mean?
In my experience, you don't only have to talk about it, but you have to hear it.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't know."
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that they need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is, let's look at similar circumstances have thought about ending their life, you've had these <unk>
It would come to the person in front of it can save the life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It has to be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home and talk about it to their friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of me to realize that Mike will not come home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with her father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and I was <unk> as that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that his car car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the afternoon before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before wrong with a real mental disease.
It should be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man where I refer to hope and value.
On March 11 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a <unk> subject on the front of the bridge near the northern tower.
I went down on the sidewalk and he looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and the next time, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided by his mind that day back on that lane and giving life another opportunity.
When Kevin was <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was it that he did, and you gave the hope to the hope and the life is <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I am <unk>
They stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give you to you.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of 11 March, and you're one of the reasons I Kevin still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly <unk>
I was going to get Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, like it says.
We give God for you.
I couldn't find debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writes <unk> When I visited the General in San Francisco that night, you were <unk> as the patient.
I know I did have to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father.
He speaks openly on the events of that day and his depression with hope that his story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, even though he finished his own pain, I have no chance to meet it.
This is what the suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think to hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is just achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've said, and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and crime calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved, only I've just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other was a man who was talked about about an hour.
During that time, I took my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one you leave on the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connects to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be able to do it.
<unk> can prevent.
There is help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but you know what you are, and one question: do you know what you are, and one question: How do you do?"
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had the dream that I had had since a little girl.
My outside eventually <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner myself.
So for complicated reasons, which I'm going to move later on, when I look at this picture -- I managed to get it -- <unk> it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that <unk> I'm first beginning.
We all give us our families, our religion, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some people have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or by the beliefs of those around us.
They're people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even, I ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as a <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wear this <unk>
And my mom asked me, "Why always take that t-shirt in <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, in fact, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never gave me to share my story, not because I thought it will be a bad, but because of how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who would accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a theoretical beauty competition.
That night she said, "Why haven't you ever engaged in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I was going, she was responsible for the past <unk> and the tickled and that night, I won in the bathroom, won in <unk> and he was a third finalist in more than 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk>
Not many people can say that their first job was the queen of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> of the <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all of that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that they passed my statement out of the green card that I could go to live to the United States.
I was shocked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I added two <unk> to my name.
She also sat at me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time, in the United States, it was necessary to be surgery before we changed the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license, with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity is meant to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was my leave to live <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but that <unk> he turned to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of November 20 in November we do a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who <unk> and stood up before injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson <unk> and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day that there is no longer any <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> -- first thank you to thank all of my <unk>
And my support network, my parents in especially my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young people who have <unk> and some times, when I was called it and they told me that his parents couldn't hold it, I took my mom and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it would work -- it's not. It's just the identity of gender, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all were assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table the subject that sometimes that assignment, not block, and there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There are still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very much. <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, to parents often know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started their campaign for education, their rights in 2007. And when they had their efforts in 2011, by <unk> the National <unk> National Prize became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when birth was a girl, his birth was not <unk>
It's not welcome nor for his father, or his mother.
The neighborhood comes back, she gives her <unk> to mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> a lot for having a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, it feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother, but the daughter. The daughter was just <unk> when it goes up, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's left home and the school reaches his siblings.
At the age of 12 years, somehow it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with his friends on the street, and it can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes up 13 years old, I read her home without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls in their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his siblings and his family and his family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that of course, honor, the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this assumption of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in behalf of the assumption of course.
And there's a norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and support the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't like.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you get it with a old man, she has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of his children.
And this vicious cycle goes on and it continues.
He was born brothers and sisters when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And a lot before I was thinking about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and he grabbed my pen, he grabbed my pen, and I wrote a line of my name, and wrote, <unk>
And when she went together when she was <unk> when I was four and a half years in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school in school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies in tribal societies, it's a big event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means your identity and his name.
So one way to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for the future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I had the form of tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit down with me when my friends came to see me.
He <unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to get them in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for <unk>
I took my daughters, I taught the students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson called <unk>
They were brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we had a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls and the singers were <unk>
<unk> billion, but it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and got up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog blog from the BBC, she was offered to her myself for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I spoke on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the 9 o'clock October 2012, was hit by <unk> in his head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would talk to my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you <unk>
It was just going to be a fair cause.
<unk> your life on play because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They both were on the right path and God <unk>
These little words -- a lot of words for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had had severe <unk> and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow going on the face of my wife.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used <unk> "I'm okay with my <unk> smile, and with my face.
I'm going to give you right. Please don't be <unk>
It was a solace for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women -- it's like any girl from 16 years old.
<unk> when he doesn't have his task.
You fight his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about special in my mentoring who has made it so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I don't tell you what I did.
I don't know what I did.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> the brain is 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined my <unk> <unk> <unk> where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
Are you still just like smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the grey matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen powerful chemical powerful every day, if you didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and chemicals, and try to <unk> to continue with life.
More than once I have saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to be able to try to get the dose of it, because there is no one map that says it in <unk>
I started to test a different <unk> and I was amazed by seeing how small changes in the dose would dramatically dramatically see my <unk> my sense of who I am, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and typical chemical doses for a twentieth man and I was amazed by looking at how I <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I was thinking about all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past have met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> fixing a problem with the front, and it just wouldn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about the men and about what they have to <unk> Since then, I am better at the men.
What I was trying to get to the adjust of these hormones and neurotransmitters and others, it was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in pictures, and that became my key point of reference -- how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk> experiences.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> looked at things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there is those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is a simple one, for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take quickly these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a theater director was able to use his imagination only to steer the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There is incredible possibilities with this, like creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments that made by two groups with the <unk>
They both used MRI technology, image by functional MRI, to represent the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain that looks at an image.
The medium of the medium shows the scan of the brain on that same individual as you <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the contents of the left column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
And in this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of reactions in the face of the video sequences.
And then I showed you a movie with new images -- new animals, new animals, and as long as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain information on the scan -- to show you what seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're well close to this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see that when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, it is believed in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scan systems that are available today, and their resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How does it <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and you can put all of it.
I don't offer me for that.
Many are proposing new projection techniques by images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first of us have to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution, not gains for thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets to make better magnets together.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI went to make magnets really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever solutions and <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio frequency in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field they are <unk> <unk> magnetic patterns of <unk> on the radio frequencies <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of radio frequencies of radio frequencies -- we can increase <unk> information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers of our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood blood fluid, but the <unk> hormones that I've mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity is sleep.
Will we be able to impose our ideas on a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how will we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool for amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options than open up this door.
Anyway, you choose one year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it'll take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just about the gay closet alone.
I think we all have <unk>
Their closet probably is to tell some person for the first time that the love or saying someone who's pregnant, or saying to someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation for which you have to go through in life.
So everything is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of they've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be <unk> by the <unk> of my pants <unk> and I had my head on my head -- I was usually a child, "Hey, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And I would have a awkward silence on the table.
I would take my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and I went through it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised you that the next time I would say something.
So that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared to get out of it with the female issues on the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> quotes <unk>
Even a snippet of the "Vagina Monologues," of the <unk>
And so I took a little bit of a little bit and went down to my shoulder -- a four-year-old dress with a pink dress staring at me, which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "Are you guys or <unk>
And so I took a little bit of again, again, I started standing close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a good thing.
I have the short hair like the one guy, and I watched clothes from boy, and I am a girl, and you know, like you like to use a <unk> <unk> and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a girl in a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me and says, "My favorite ninja is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> <unk>
And that was it. He was just like, "Oh well, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that we <unk>
It was the easiest thing to ever ever had.
And because of <unk> because the girl from the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, you can't know what color walls.
You just know how one feels like a closet.
This is how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons why to go out of my closet was harder to get out of it, but this is the <unk> it's hard not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to somebody who have declared them on banking it is harder to say it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I say is harder than telling your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's just the hard thing.
We need to stop considering what is hard to make us feel better or worse to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we have to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than what it provides the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made out of your walls, a <unk> not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, that he had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian <unk> to fight any child from four years to go to the coffee.
I was frozen by the fear of <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay dad, and the moving move only is the darkest thing I ever have.
My family, my friends, very strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to <unk> and now the world was going back to purpose.
He was burning the pages of an script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of them were invited to know that it was gay, and by making my lady <unk> and <unk> and walked around the tables and finally came around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known to me for me.
And after talking a moment, one of the women I said, <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, yeah, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about <unk>
You know, what is your favorite TV show.
Our <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I expected to show desperately his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
It's like the hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask anyone with the ones that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I continue to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves going out of any self is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will stay hoping that that might change.
Don't give you a false sense of hope.
And number three, more important --  Let the complex complex ones.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be solved by that.
And some of you can come out safe <unk> so they have done, but they never worry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet, <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is so interesting as the question of if a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to the pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms behind intelligence.
Let's take a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth and of the Earth of Earth or the Earth's intelligence on Earth, but they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know about this, which has no concept about the Earth's intelligence on Earth -- you would be forced to develop a physical theory that explains how to certain times in time, the asteroids that we would <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we will understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, I think, for a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be traced to development for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, on robotic movement planning there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to do complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, for a number of years ago, there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force -- F, that acts with the end of maximizing the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open options with a force force, with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yeah, until an impending time, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain open.
And so, when you realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
We will make the human intelligence level.
<unk> <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> in their life they should be able to make conditions more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long run, but that actually emerges directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy of long-term entropy in any system where you meet inside.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal tests -- playing human games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without being asked to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing standing here -- we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This skill skill will have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance.
This capacity of use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against themselves, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections on a social network where friends are constantly constantly and keeps the networking network.
This same capacity capacity capacity is also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering them successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend globally, its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> by increasing assets under their state management systems.
This ability for risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as using tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all flow from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of using the word <unk> the work <unk> there was always the concept that if we were smart machines there would have a rebellion in it.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the greatest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of the rebellion in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart, and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out of control, instead of being the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask, "How do you look for goals will get through this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence, is this: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the rest of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even over the last few years, we've expanded our insights to how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is pointing to the Earth is only one among the billions of planets from our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that will go.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their mother.
Instead, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light they get out of their own.
At the time, this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The hottest year was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us for us for millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused to a global scale have moved quickly our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a climate scientist, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet by influenced by the stars, with hope of finding places in the universe where we found life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets similar to the Earth, more than our own planet.
Every single one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the last single planet, and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world to show this for a mission like that.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and partly -- that's why we studied so much about Mars.
Our <unk> as the <unk> track its surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission, take samples from the atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
So private companies offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images -- they remind us to remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a fairly terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of <unk> areas of our planet that still stay at <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and higher places on Earth -- the air is cool and full of oxygen -- and filled with oxygen in our forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement of the colonization of Mars and other planets will come out with a big and sad planets to <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars would wait for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable Earth.
And so I like to like exploration -- I am deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for humanity is how to imagine that the captain of Titanic will tell us that the party actually will have place later on the <unk>    Thank you.
But the targets for exploring <unk> and Earth preservation -- not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
They only get closer than home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> spaces of the land, perhaps we could satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment with <unk> <unk> paradox.
A lot of years ago, Enrico Fermi Enrico Fermi asked me to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi it is that when civilizations are become advanced enough to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the important thing is to protect the origin of planets that we <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization, will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I had my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window on the dining table, where they were at the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and they were all very closed up.
I thought I call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I could not come home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I went from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but it's sure not more expensive than a <unk> at the night -- so I thought, that even though the circumstances, I was living right away.
I'm a career a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases your heart rhythm, <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk>
And when I got to the counter <unk> in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, the systems that I could put in his place, which would be <unk> that there was bad things.
Or at least, if bad things happen, the probability of it is a total catastrophe,
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize and a little embarrassed I told him that I broke my passport, and Danny <unk> and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight
It's something that he had learned from psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then try to figure out what can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with obvious ones.
In the house, you get a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to follow the location of the things important, where the fish are right, where the fish, the <unk> trees live where the friends are living and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows us to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that are going to move on.
This is the reason to lose keys on the car, glasses of reading and <unk>
So at home I put a place for keys, a hook up next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular instrument?
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you put a place and they are <unk> with it all these things will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card license, passport, <unk> by mail themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are <unk> or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situations that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care future or a loved thing to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very specific medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of it takes for all of medical decisions, and in fact for human decisions and social decisions -- any kind of a decision that we need to take out of that we would benefit from a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the outcome of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack, heart <unk>
So one is thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and he knows that it's one of the most important drugs in the world today, you may even know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for the majority of doctors don't want to talk about, and companies have even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or whether you have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And it must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault -- it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs only works about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely more widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help one person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, oil spill or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more, and it is, <unk> from the <unk> right?
For this particular drug, the side effects produce in five percent of patients.
And those include things that include <unk> severe muscle pain and <unk> pain, but now they think, about five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
And remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how it would look at the time, so you don't have to make the data chain on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has spent five percent of the 300 -- have side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that you can help your drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
And you may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air through the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
To the surgery that is done in the older men from 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number necessary to try is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you get lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just give you a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can ask to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice so many times, they want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that might have much pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> to face with a predatory <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending spending the metabolism in those things, it's not going very quickly. You could get the <unk> lunch, so it really matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that is going through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail rather than time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to prevent things bad at the first place.
I went to the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination alongside the door, with a key door to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't seen, and lots of text messages I've never seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even stronger.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can come up with never a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the 1950s and over the time with time, mixed up with local signs, and he developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I now realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms and <unk>
So how do I understand sound about it?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people respond to it.
So I've learned for example ...
"You don't mean <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> <unk> <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's why it's coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
It was going to go on.
<unk> <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to make it with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, to an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to be <unk>
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not just experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could tell me.
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like not having a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can help me feel like equal and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in the work, I work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when we ask for <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't capture and express fully in the paper.
And the same thing can be said from a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signs of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into lots of different <unk>
If you combine a different <unk> for each finger while the facial expression, the movement of the body, the <unk> speed, the way that the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> just one key at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a concept of clear or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change it, it would create a completely different means.
The same thing is happening with music in terms of tone <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign of it, and it would take it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun goes out and it goes on.
This is all day."
If you go through it, and you look at the <unk> and you look at it as a piece of music.
All day long.
I feel that the same thing can be called <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night on this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how much distance into the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present closer to the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last thing that is my favorite, with a very romantic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All with the hands up.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please raise it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they do very different meanings there.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as music.
However, today, we live in a very crowded world.
And only because <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allowing the <unk> to grow their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, you know, they don't have to hear <unk>
The <unk> is a rich trove of treasure.
I'd like to get to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know it can be in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Democracy, involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble bubble or a bubble of ignorance -- I should say, because adults would lie to us from the awful truth.
When I was older, I learned that adults also <unk> and they're not very good for cleaning up the other ones.
The time country, now I'm an adult and teaching citizenship and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk on the beach <unk> with lots of crap.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but now more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming up with these big vessels and networks, to collect those chunks of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very <unk> and it's also very risky to use those enormous ones.
So with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work with <unk> so that the children very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you, the kids who handle the electrical tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
So that we do.
I leave you with the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to figure it out in something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot of the robots.
Then we started quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast.
And we would take light bulbs and web cameras on accessories. And they would put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the plastic chunks floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measuring the size of each <unk> to get a shape of plastic in the water.
It was going to go through this <unk> invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would make it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to fix them immediately.
I'm looking at my problem with me, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this image.
A kid, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill -- only using the hands in <unk> the world's greatest <unk> in Bangladesh.
And they were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water that <unk> the water where they live in.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what water is.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all sorts of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what is in the water.
And we took this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help form other children.
I was forced to do a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, perhaps to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half a French and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a moment.
It also gives the nuclear power plant.
And today, according to the reports for a 300 metric tons -- they're still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution from <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast and most of the time, it has safe and it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the accident and research in independently of other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we went into the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discuss the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And with this, we could see that the radioactive powder was <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition plus close to the nuclear power to date.
We zoom up to five miles of nuclear plant and with the help of fishermen in the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking of sediment as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies as well.
But at the same time, it's increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we become the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood metal -- chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, can be built almost from all there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or well, we can help the mobility population transforming their standard wheelchair in new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We can't afford to protect kids from the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So ordinary citizens scientists, creators, we need to make the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people and so that it can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one line of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One is <unk> on the environment, the other thing I thought of.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that is free to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information required for every cell to work and <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> by manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world done in the parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of material material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pore.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter, the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a broken screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality personality and architect to work on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and right, and <unk> and <unk> shows up in the two screens after me.
My job at the most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for it 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where four disciplines that give designers access to the tools we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large scale, like this robotic arm with a stretch of 24 feet in the base that was not very far to print <unk> buildings, and graphs to the nanoscale made of genetically <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here we have <unk> a archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where each sexes is only to model light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion fashion with <unk> they are <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with <unk> 3D printing -- we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> without seams between cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull combined and rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an MRI machine.
That designers have access to this high resolution and the <unk> instruments that allows us to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair -- comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
The professor Carter -- my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> surface pattern, it becomes <unk>
They would take this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> on pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, vary their functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jewish home but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me, and it got to define a lot of what it matters.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world done about parts.
I often wonder, "What would the design would be if you were all made from one part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the material -- the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, nor <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a lot of husks of <unk> the <unk> and produced toothpaste.
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material on the march and create these structures made from a single 3.5 billion <unk>
When the pieces are lists, it leaves it to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why are we designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process to be used to contain <unk> <unk> that first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems from <unk> to mesh and if it extends even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree blade <unk>
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects, designed to make them in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, will be able to grow a tree.
The fits for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for the <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> table, we did our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new biological basic within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these so-called <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human brain.
One makes light light on sugar, another sugar and produces biofuels to the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
So to contain these relationships, we created a single channel that resembles the <unk> tract that will help <unk> these bacteria and that they would make their function <unk>
So we started making those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> you would make more transparent channels.
This system <unk> system -- when it stretches from one end to another, it's 200 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are -- "We are mostly <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that make matter <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, the <unk> tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
And so you know that a 3D printer prints in layers.
You also know that nature does not do this.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates highly sophisticated architecture a home inside which is <unk>
The manufacturing is not going to go on to this level of <unk>
It does it by the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, assembling those fibers in each other.
And this is happening across the scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, create a tension, structure, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
With the end of the better understanding how this complex process works, we attach a tiny imam to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with onboard sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the worm worm worm worm <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, and we realized that they <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death to death in their <unk> their silk <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can form <unk> silk without a single <unk>
They <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot by making elements of silk, and we put it into our site.
We knew that silk worms are moving into the darker and more dark areas that we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, distributing silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked ourselves, <unk> silk silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> -- they got <unk> put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
As the biological silk on <unk> silk -- they give all this entire pavilion their integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, you know, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other fills empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form a ecology of two materials, designers should bring these two visions of the world.
What it takes us from around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new age of creation, which brings us from design inspired by nature to an inspired nature in the design, which requires us, for the first time, that we take in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were asked when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English and the <unk> and art and online websites, and also, I played the guitar in a rock band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But in time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this feeling is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to get it up.
But then I was fascinated by something else, something completely different, and I was going to focus on it, and I'm going to let me feel <unk> I have found him <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to bring it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because he wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this stuff into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me because of nothing.
I was concerned about engagement, or being <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have a set of then.
<unk> themselves where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where <unk> learned from culture.
You ask the first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to do.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question takes us over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up at university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the nice exercise of before the dream.
Why?
So if this question is inspired by kids to dream about what might be, not inspire dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, it does right now, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are probably <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine founded in <unk> <unk> and a creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to spend during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and spend your life on it.
But if you're somebody who's not connected to this way?
What if there are lots of different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And I feel there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Is you a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you divide into three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance the ideal was the one who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You know, any term you might like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, which is that there's huge strengths in being this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in terms of data, travel, travel, mathematics and design, when they found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
In <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of her <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is on intersections.
From there comes the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is hard learning.
When we were <unk> we got into something, we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to try new things and get out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we've learned to every new area that we <unk> so we rarely start to zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and an independent <unk>
As a young pianist <unk> an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I became a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
It had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they were starting their <unk> and this skill helps to write something compelling for editors.
<unk> is a waste of time to be able to get what you would do -- even if at the end of the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field in a way that you wouldn't have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. It is, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other designer designer, sometimes consultant on Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, it would be James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> Magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to satisfy the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if you're a pressure to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a big interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in thinking ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to be connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in large part they will be told to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing you take from this talk -- I hope it's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart, then <unk> by all the media.
That's where you give the best of you.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
So the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring takes us to a more authentic and happy.
And perhaps most importantly, we will save the world to us.
Thank you.
In the year we had a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric psychiatric institution.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for it until that, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After their death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange plates, and they found strange plates, in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprising.
If you have been living today, we couldn't give her more help than the thing that <unk> gave him a couple of years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer -- <unk> for <unk> <unk> for the <unk> and much more.
But they have made progress in Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimers now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, it'll affect 150 million which, by the way, include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's is almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability of spending their years Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be wanted Alzheimer's disease.
Just in America, health care costs 200 dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- a increase in five times in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> booms at the other.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges and our generation.
But it has been relatively low to <unk>
Now one of the first 10 causes of death from all around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research itself.
The United States government spends 10 times more every year in cancer cancer that Alzheimer's despite the fact that they costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a half billion deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but all the industrialized world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us, even scientists, Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy human brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to Alzheimer's reduces significantly life expectancy.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strange <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of proteins.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these points end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plate and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and it is <unk> of what step block is complex, like a bomb.
You could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we can do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the cables and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematician.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process -- now it's testing a new kind of drugs that are blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened to the test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These maggots, on the other hand, have the protein molecules that stick between each other inside them, as humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they are clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome -- but research as this shows Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we put it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move forward in the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the New York Times column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article comes from a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to prove it as a summer last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strange <unk> to get 36 more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake tomorrow morning with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When did the last time you get someone else person?
And <unk>
And in <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number one: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to him, or her, I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I first came across this study a few years ago, a detail really called me attention, <unk> that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to <unk>
And yet, we were <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the spinal column, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, they stay together yet.
And the reason I think this is why I think this is because you've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the article was <unk> I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog input can come up with a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just my friends on Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably about thousands of it.
And that had a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as we gave it no idea.
The article was published on Friday on Friday at night, and on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday already had been called the <unk> Today and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was like, I say something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing <unk> but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or I had it, what they did every day for weeks, always, doing first the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was setting this talk, I made a quick search on the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on the radio and he <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
And I realize this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international crisis, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for Saint <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> orders from all of us two.
I think he was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study would work, they wanted to know if it was really <unk> or it is, if it was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel like to answer.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, mostly that people posed the wrong question.
How do you know if you put them together or not, and they also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal approach, between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study does it work.
The participants were felt closer to doing doing -- several studies -- then then they used <unk> protocol as a rapid way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of police and the community. They have used them among people of political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combine personal questions with four minutes of visual contact -- was cited in this paper, but unfortunately he never got published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student approached me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to tell you about the person with whom you can do it.
Well he did a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they did achieve better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost all my adult life, and he was my first real love -- and he had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I was in science.
I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a certain way to make the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought I just went to work for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was fascinated with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been helpful in one or another way.
I'm more patient with love, I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in requiring what I look at.
But I can also see me more clearly and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than what I'm going to demand for me.
What I'm looking for love is a sculptor, not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee of what people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media said about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to achieve some way to mitigate some of the risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because <unk> makes us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still together?
And their content with a <unk> answer or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How are things going to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when things are <unk> and how to know when you cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship? Or even more, how you live in <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they are a good beginning to have a better conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, a <unk> study in order to create romantic love -- we still continue on, and I'm very <unk>
But <unk> is not the same as being <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article -- <unk> love didn't happen.
There was fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at reading it now, not because it's not true, but because in the moment, there was no matter everything I was supposed to be that choice, in the moment.
It didn't look at how many times we would have to make that decision, and how long they will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose to be able to be able to do it.
I want you to be enough to be done and responded to someone as generous, as nice and fun and fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what we <unk> and what I might maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to have the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually written.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he would also love me, and it's frightening, but that's a scary deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a black <unk> and in a way, I came up like a forest <unk>
The city of New York ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took a ticket for a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how do we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's about <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
And at a time I was in <unk> <unk> like to go to <unk> and make <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and did a kind of <unk> he was in the style of Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin in the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite: somehow it seemed like the size of size, as if it was <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did built more boxes.
And this time, I started adding electronic elements that we could find out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow out of just drawing the same as it does about a <unk> <unk>
And I pulled up the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens and <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was shocked.
I didn't know what to do, because it was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
So I started drawing on the glass, similar to the drawing on a window, then in another window, and he had all these windows and had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left is Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all of these creatures have head of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with <unk> creatures are headed to the <unk> lists for suicide in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while in the other hand, they would come back.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> a tail of snake that binds to <unk>
But anyway, his tail does a tail in <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
Their tail ends up in a eye of <unk> made from protective Mother's <unk>
They've <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Every one is an archive of our culture, through media and material will be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human, and they travel in 20 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm bringing it up.
Each one is basically a microscope, which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can see the entrance to you.
I'm going to show you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of thing that was <unk>
It's a quick practice of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There is some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue of it.
There's a small scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
But anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a scientist, a musician, a musician, a <unk> one of the radio, a school, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
You know, <unk> the box and all the people in it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that they're living in.
And together we got to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from the <unk> of religion is not working.
We're all very made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first happens by the stomach, the guts and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective and more effective system for any drug to make it effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug will <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they serve the amount of virus in the blood, and increase <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects of <unk> in its most negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the stream -- you will be <unk> and worse at the time that it takes to get to its destiny, which is where it's more important, in the HIV deposit of HIV.
These are regions of the body as the lymph nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that <unk> the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a treatment of life run by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> making the treatment directly at the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use in <unk> for wounds and surgery and diabetes -- can be used for anything else, including transportation transport of drugs.
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes that open and closed almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best you ask, "How do that <unk>
And we sent a little bit of laser beam on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of time.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or on <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first brain, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second brain, which is a camera, it goes to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, it frees it directly into the infection, while the laser used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all <unk> researcher in our case, a <unk> treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not shooting at them.
My goal is to understand better to these <unk> agents and study ways of encouraging violent participation.
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> <unk>
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, <unk> peace agreements in 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well for the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they didn't get to.
The armed struggle and the political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in 1980, <unk> has also established a political party a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> met by his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking up.
It was a complex machinery of communication -- radio radio channels online TV sites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising but by doing business -- for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit them to better and build their brand.
<unk> groups are also doing something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't make security and protection.
The <unk> of Taliban in an Afghanistan torn torn by war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups for making security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price for the population.
But, in general, providing social services means to fill a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 from Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we analyzed the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups participate in violent struggle and provide governance.
And the more complex and more complex are these organizations, we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, running all of their functions, pick up all of their functions, they run the <unk> system.
This is a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
<unk> <unk>
We live in a world of states, in no state and hybrids and the weakest ones are states, as in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in military tools.
And we had this government of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and raising peace.
If we understand better groups, we will understand what incentives will offer to encourage violence transition from violence to violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors not <unk> military power can win some <unk> but not to give us peace and stability.
So to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security void to fill that whole system of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label would be <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I was amazed as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what it started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and they <unk> the sex as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are treated all around the world, and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled a feminist was a <unk> word <unk>
I was <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asks too much, high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It was the same paycheck for the same job.
We have the right to travel around the world as it <unk> free of bullying or violence.
We have right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing to controls <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body -- expression of gender, religion and ideas, our social condition, skills and much more.
We have to have to account at these differences and how we behave in the same way that it matters in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive the work, I listen to rap music volume.
Even though the letter degrades to women and <unk> deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of yin yang is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical hands.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
They went from fashion magazines, and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I am not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable to the way that women are born.
I would take this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color, gay workers, gay workers, gay women, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist thing.
It also happens the following, as a <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we hope that we would need perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of taste of the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to be <unk> from that <unk> before I try to wear there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative people, and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged like <unk>
They are afraid of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that label means for fear is not going to be able to go with a little realistic expectation of it.
Take an example of <unk> or like I call it. The <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist subject.
In the <unk> Music Music 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star in the pop star embracing feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began arguments, if we <unk> it was or not exactly feminist.
It was their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection with the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we want a lot, we need so much.
We are going to go far beyond sensible criticism -- and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to pick up something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions make this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think about my three and four years.
These are two girls who are <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
The strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is all about sexual violence against women as a sports, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go into the cinema in another part when movies are not treated women as well as objects like that.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes are dealing with their fellow as <unk>
In any case, the men, especially these men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish his magazine, participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a long number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or his organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to engage in this kind of projects, we can also <unk> to be even more likely to be even more likely to get to overcome barriers to the decision-making jobs.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, people in the power and traffic producers and music, <unk> <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell the courage to make our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be a <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, especially because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was focusing on a stronger version of myself.
And the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked at me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if it was a little brave -- another woman could hear and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I claim the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little brave when you need to be a bit more courageous, when you need to be a bit more <unk>
Right after Christmas of last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> or for being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be lousy for a child with a immune system -- is one of the most easily preventable, diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak of <unk> had not been immunized because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked for being an <unk> fraud by British Medical Medical Council.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines have a danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth of autism in time.
During most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of it was creating all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence remained stable only three or four children for every planet.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> for funds as <unk> <unk> are routinely referred to autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Disease Control what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis and "A better detection detection to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language is not <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks at the face of his son of two years old, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why was the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science of the storytelling.
During most of the 20th century, doctors told doctors a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a psychiatrist "Hi Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be <unk> private worlds -- <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by shaking their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey of panic by <unk> as when I didn't put his favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s authority of the world in the subject, he declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as it <unk> references from places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria for autism was very <unk>
For example, we would give up that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once he got bored that he had turned nine from every 10 children to her office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child is caused by sad parents.
These kids, he said, they have been carefully kept on a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that we set up in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records. He correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like kids were simply <unk> what they heard their parents were desperate to win their approval approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, turning invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> in London, I thought the theory of <unk> mothers in <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John was warm and warm and had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as a child and no support, no special education and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend for the National National Women's Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that was going to have done about 30 years before.
They did a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw -- of course that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse things.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
The other way, these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> as he said <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to a paper published in German in <unk> the next year to the <unk> article -- and then he got married, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
I had not even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he would do it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic, they started with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of dealing with kids in their clinic as patients, because he called them their little teachers, and they got to help the development of education that were particularly suitable for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that was held by an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture, such as the awkward social and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
He <unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with autism was <unk> so that the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American American Association to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late '80s, their changes in the '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a wide <unk>
These changes don't sit in a broken bag.
<unk> when he <unk> and Judith worked with the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world to see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out, <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four Nobel <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these evidence created a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started by <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was, so they had to get people with autism and their families finally would bring the support and the services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnosis. A simple, powerful story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention of prevention in the United States are right in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that they're the puzzles to solve for new doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
A way to understand <unk> is to think about in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to details.
Certainly autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> that I believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding of teachers, employers with ability, communities and support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on deck and <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
